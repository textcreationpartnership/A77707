         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Though the former be more excellent, as more familiar and publick in its uſe (every one not being able to wade into Controverſie) yet this latter hath its profit, and is alſo neceſſary: and therefore the Apostle requires that a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop be able by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort and convince the gain-ſayers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170001:9"/> Tit. <hi>1.9, 10, 11.</hi> and his reaſon is, <hi>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, ſpecially they of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, whoſe mouths muſt be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, who ſubvert whole houſes, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things which they ought not for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucres ſake.</hi> Of this nature is this book before thine eyes, compoſed and ſet forth upon ſerious and conſiderate grounds. The occaſion offered hath an influx upon its compoſure, the ſeaſonableneſs of it (as the Author conceives) occaſions its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing. The occaſion was this; a Popiſh Gentleman with whom I had ſome converſe having had the loan of a Proteſtant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of mine, in requitall brought me this Popiſh Doctor, as worth my reading, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting (as I conceived) that I ſhould ſay ſomething to it, which at firſt I thought to do very briefly and ſuddenly. But finding the book full of errors, and the ſtudy of a reply delightfull and ſuitable to my ſtudies, wherein (by occaſion of the place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt whom Gods providence had caſt me) I had been moſt imployed, next to my ſpeciall Ministeriall duties, eſpecially,

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I may well retort your words with a little variation, and ſay, that of ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions profeſſed in the Chriſtian world, and in ſpecial in this Land (if we may juſtly call the ſeveral opinions and wayes of worſhip <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Religions</hi>) ſeveral writers, men of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved integrity and profound learning have moſt clearly demonſtrated, that there is only one ttue, and that not the now Roman, but that which the reformed Churches do hold and maintain is it: So that mens rejecting of it cannot be imputed to any want of truth, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Religion, but to other cauſes, amongſt which your two ſhall have the leading in my Catalogue. 1. Prejudice in them that have read our works, yet give no credit to them; nor can it be otherwiſe with you, whilſt your faith is pin'd upon others ſleeves: Let us ſpeak never ſo much reaſon, let our aſſertions be plain Scripture, yet if your Prieſts affirm it not, you will not believe us, yea many times when you are convinced of the truth of our aſſertions, you will not believe them becauſe they are ours, as if a truth might be an error becauſe we hold it: When <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that the Jewiſh Sacraments, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in ſigns, yet were the ſame in ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170001:17"/> with ours, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">

Sure if we have thoughts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing theſe men, we muſt write for Popery, and then they will become Proteſtants for fear of joyning with us in our opinions, which are dangerous, meerly becauſe we hold them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Impatience of labour, Papiſts will not ſet themſelves to read our books, or if they read, not to ſtudy them; ſhould I go over theſe parts where I live, I believe I ſhould not finde one Papiſt that doth ſeriouſly read our books, nor can tell you truly what we hold, they ſpend their time in other things, and will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to imploy themſelves this way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The reſtraint that is laid upon them that they dare not read them, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> by his Bull forbad Papiſts to look into the books of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170001:18"/> 
                  <hi>Calvin, Bucer, Bullinger,</hi> and ſuch like Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques as he calls them, contrary to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Proteſtants, who are permitted to read Popiſh Books; Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> takes notice of this injunction (<hi>Reynold. praelec.</hi> 3. <hi>de lib.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170001:19"/> of the Goſpel, thoſe lively repreſenters of Jeſus Chriſt, and to railings and invectives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of controverſie. When I conſider theſe things, I cannot but pity the common ſort of Papiſts, and withal admire the impudency of their Prieſts, who while they cry up the peoples freedom of will, yet flatly deny them to have any judgment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deſire to know who theſe Authors you mention are, and whether they are yet unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered? I'm ſure there are many learned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers extant to the Popiſh books formerly written, and for the late ones they are not yet grown common, as they come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of learned men, I doubt not but they will receive their anſwers: In the meane time, (though the meaneſt of that Tribe that deſires to be learned) I have attempted to anſwer your book, to which I now (depending on the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit) do addreſs my ſelf.</p>

Are not the acts of underſtanding and will means to ſupernatural happineſs? for by <hi>them</hi> he ſeeks and finds out God as he is the Author of Grace; by theſe he cleaves and unites, and ſo enjoys God his Saviour and Redeemer. When you ſay, Sect. 3. that <hi>by faith a man comes to the knowledg of God as he is the Author and End of Grace,</hi> do not you think that faith is an act of the underſtanding or will? But you were ſo big-bellyed with the Church, that you travelled to be delivered of it, and therefore not heeding what you have ſaid, you tell us of a Conformity of Faith to the Church. 2. I confound Means of divers natures, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that are proximate, and have an agency or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170001:20"/> activity in them, as underſtanding and will; and thoſe that are remote, and do only diſpoſe and help thoſe proximate and active means towards their intended end. The proximate means of natural and ſupernatural happineſs are the ſame, only thoſe faculties are helped as to natural happineſs by the Books of Nature and the Creatures, as to ſupernatural happineſs by the Word of God contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old and New Teſtament: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16.17. <hi>John</hi> 17.3. 3. Your Conformity of Faith to the Church in a Popiſh ſence, is a novel phraſe, not uſed by the firſt Chriſtians nor the Apoſtles of Chriſt in any of their writings; nor did they ever bid men beleeve as the Church beleeved (though that was of greater authority then the preſent Church is,) but ſtill called their faith to the Word of God; contrary to which, if <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other Apoſtles, yea or Angels from Heaven, did preach, the people were to reject them; and no doubt if <hi>Paul</hi> had preached ſuch ſtuff, as now Popiſh Sermons are filled with traditions and new decrees ungrounded on Gods Word, the <hi>Beraeans</hi> had rejected him and his praying. It was for want of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Faith to the Word of God, that our Saviour upbraids the two Diſciples that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to <hi>Emaus, Luk.</hi> 24.25. He ſaith not, O flow of heart to beleeve all that the Church
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170001:21"/> beleeves, (this as I ſaid was no Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor known to primitive Chriſtians;) but <hi>to beleeve all that the Prophets have ſpoken:</hi> And that he may lead them to this Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith, he expounds not the Decrees and Conſtitutions of Scribes and Phariſees (who ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair) whereof there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but 'tis ſaid, <hi>Beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf,</hi> verſ. 27. Sir, I beleeve you are ſo dutiful a ſon to the Church, that had you been in Chriſts ſtead, you would rather have told them of Popes decretal Epiſtles then of Prophets, writings of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rather then Scripture, if ſuch things then had had a being. But 4. Why could not you ſay a Conformity of Faith to the Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, as well as a Conformity of Faith to the Church revealing the Truth? The Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, not the Church revealing it, is the Rule of Faith, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter. 1. You might have done well once for all to have told us what you mean by The Church; for the word is diverſly attributed even by thoſe who in general agree that it is only the Roman Church, as you ſeem by your Epiſtle to the Reader to underſtand it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You urge Scripture to prove your Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> three Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. The two firſt do not ſo much as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170001:21"/> mention the word <hi>Church;</hi> the laſt mentions the word, but proves not the thing you bring it for.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Going, teach ye all Nations. Anſ.</hi> I wonder in what word the proof lies. I ſuppoſe it's not in <hi>Going;</hi> and I dare ſay <hi>Teaching</hi> proves it not; for then every Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould be a Rule of Faith: beſides, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were not to teach men to hang their faith upon themſelves or others, whether of the Roman or any other Church; but they were commanded to teach men to do whatſoever Chriſt had commanded, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. amongſt which this was the principal work, <hi>to believe on him whom God had ſent (Joh.</hi> 6.29.) <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, to whom they were brought by the Apoſtles preaching, as living ſtones to be built upon a foundation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me. Anſ.</hi> I ſuppoſe this Text is brought to explain the other, which had need of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary to make it ſpeak your language. But, 1. This is ſpoken primarily and abſolutely of the Apoſtles, who were Chriſts mouth in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Scriptures, and therefore infallibly inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, that they could not err in what they delivered to us. That which <hi>Moſes</hi> was to the Jews in delivering the Law, the ſame were the Apoſtles to us in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Goſpel: So that he that heareth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170001:22"/> the Apoſtles, heareth Chriſt, becauſe it was the word of Chriſt which they did ſpeak; and this way we hear the Apoſtles ſpeak yet, whileſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ordinary Miniſters in the Church, it can only be underſtood conditionally; <hi>He that heareth you</hi> (while your doctrine agreeth with the Word of God) <hi>heareth me:</hi> ſo that faith is not a conformity to any Teachers or their doctrine, but ſo far as their doctrine is agreeable with the Scriptures, which indeed are the Rule both of their preaching and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. Conſonantly hereunto the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſom words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt—he is proud—from ſuch withdraw thy ſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, who were the Church in a Popiſh ſence, were to be heard, but it was whileſt they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, that is, whileſt they preached not their own traditions and phancies, but <hi>Moſes</hi> doctrine. <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Elucid in Mat.</hi> 23.)

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170001:23"/> by humane diſcourſe founded on the principles of Reaſon, nor by reliance upon Authority meerly humane, but Only by Faith Grounded On The Word of GOD, revealing unto men things that were otherwiſe, only known to his infinite Wiſdom, —ſeeing the Church to the worlds end muſt be built on the Apoſtles, and Believe Nothing as Matter of Faith beſide that which was delivered of them, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. Your ſelf alſo, when you come to the Point to ſpeak of the Rule of Faith, ſay, that <hi>the Truth of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and expreſſed to us, is the Rule of Faith, Chap.</hi> 9. If Faith be grounded on Gods Word, and that this Word of God be the Rule of Faith, How can the Church be it, ſeeing there is a vaſt difference betwixt the Truth and the Church, as betwixt a Rule and him that bears it: Can you ſay properly, that a man that keeps the ſtandard in his houſe is the ſtandard, or that the poſt that bears it is it, or that the ſhip that carries the compaſs is the compaſs? Now you only ſay, that the Church is the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> it doth but bear it. If the Church be the Rule of Faith, then I wonder what Rule they have, ſure not themſelves; and they being men like us, they cannot be without a Rule, no more then they can be Chriſtians, and yet want faith.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Diverſities of Faiths, Hopes, and Charities.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter I ſhall only take notice of two paſſages. 1. You ſay, <hi>The means of habitual and actual divine (Faith, Hope and Charity) is the Tradition of the Church.</hi> Anſ. 1. If by <hi>the Tradition of the Church</hi> you mean the true and right Expoſition of Scripture made by faithful Paſtors and Teachers of the Church, as <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> underſtands it, then I ſhall eaſily conſent to you; for it is no more then the Apoſtle himſelf aſſerts when he ſaith, <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God, Rom.</hi> 10.17. But 2. If you mean the Churches opinions diſtinct from Scripture or unwritten Verities, as they are called by you, then I affirm that theſe are not means for your propoſed end; the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170001:25"/> Scripture it ſelf, without your additions, being ſufficient to make the man of God perfect in all graces: And this you are not altogether unconvinced of, as appears by your Preachers, who in their Sermons do ground their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon Texts of Scriptures, and I ſuppoſe their Sermons are intended to be means of faith, hope, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>St Paul—gives to Charity the preeminence: And not undeſervedly; for ſhe is the enlivening Soul of Faith and Hope, &amp;c. both they—being (out of her company) as dead bodies without life or motion, &amp;c.</hi> Your aſſertion is grounded upon two Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. and <hi>James</hi> 2.26. For the firſt, I freely ſubſcribe to the preeminence of Charity, but upon the Apoſtles reaſon (not yours,) which is the continuance of Charity when Faith and Hope fail: Thus the Apoſtle is underſtood by your ordinary Gloſs, <hi>Primaſius, Auguſtine,</hi> and the generality of Expoſitors: <hi>In preſenti tria haec,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lyran. in</hi> 1 Cor. 13.13.</note> 
                  <hi>in futuro ſola charitas permanebit; Majus eſt ergo quod ſemper erit quam quod aliquando ceſſabit.</hi> But you ſay, <hi>It's the Soul of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> This I deny: For, 1. Your own Authors do earneſtly contend that true faith, yea that faith that juſtifies, and is joyned with hope and charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. may be without charity; charity therefore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170001:25"/> cannot be the ſoul of faith; for the enlivening ſoul cannot be abſent from its body, and yet that body remain a true living humane body. 2. The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>faith without works is dead,</hi> as the body without the ſoul; yet you will not ſay that good works are the ſoul of faith, whereby it hath life and motion. Your Rhemiſts aſſert it, that the Thief on the Croſs wanted good works, and thereupon conclude,<note place="margin">Rhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Annot. on Luke <hi>23.43.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>Faith, hope, &amp;c. will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and good works not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, where for want of time and opportunity they cannot be had.</hi> Now can you ſay, that his faith was without life and motion? It had ſo much life and motion, that it brought him to Heaven by your own confeſſion. Now if the body move, it hath the ſoul in it, be its motion never ſo little, or of ſo ſhort continuance. 3. Faith is before Charity, and that not only by priority of nature, but of agency or activity: Faith is a leading grace. Men firſt believe to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then make confeſſion to Salvation. Faith firſt apprehends and lays hold on the mercy and goodneſs of God in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and then for that his goodneſs and mercy towards us we do love him and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. This is clearly taught by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. as <hi>Salmeron, Tolet, Stella,</hi> and others, even Papiſts, acknowledg. Now in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170001:26"/> the Soul precedes the body in its activity. 4. If charity and good works were the ſoul of faith, they ſhould be intrinſecal to faith, for the form is not out of the matter, nor the ſoul out of the body: but ſo they are not. Hence 'tis that ſome learned men call charity an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form of faith, and other virtues; and by <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the Text they underſtand <hi>the breath,</hi> making the ſence this, Even as the want of breath argues a dead body, ſo the want of works a dead faith. <hi>Eſtius</hi> aſcribes this Expoſition to <hi>Cajetan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſtius in Jam. <hi>2.26.</hi>
                  </note> who as he ſaith <hi>was moved to it by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe works are not the form of faith, but certain concomitant effects; but the ſoul is the form of the body. Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> clearly adheres to <hi>Cajetan,</hi>

                  </note> denying charity to be an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal form of faith, or other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, becauſe they have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fruit, and produce works without charity; only he calls it an extrinſecal form, which will never prove it to be the ſoul of them.<note place="margin">Par. in loc.</note>

                  </gap>, not <hi>without ſoul,</hi> but <hi>without ſpirit or breath. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſpeaks moſt ſuitably to this Expoſition, <hi>Sicut corporis vitam, &amp;c.</hi> As we know the life of the body by motion, ſo the life of faith by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170001:26"/> good works. If this Expoſition pleaſe not, I ſhall commend to you that acute one of Mr <hi>Perkins;</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Perkins on Galat. <hi>5.6.</hi>
                  </note> Here is a falſe compoſition of the words; <hi>Faith that is without works is dead,</hi> is true; but to ſay, <hi>Faith is dead without works</hi> (as though they gave life to faith) is falſe. To conclude; Though we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny charity or good works to be the enlivening ſoul of faith, yet we aſſert them to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable concomitants of a true faith: ſo that as good works cannot be without faith, ſo neither can faith be without good works. As faith looks towards the promiſe by beleeving it, ſo doth it reflect upon the Will of God by obeying it; theſe are its two vital acts, that is internal, this is faith's external act, neither of which can a living faith not exerciſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Churches Power and Infallibility in matters of Faith.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter you come to the Churches Infallibility as a main part of Religion, and a leading Article in the Creed, to whom you are ſo liberal, that you leave little to Chriſt or his Father. It's the obſervation of one of your
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170001:27"/> own men, that <hi>throughout your Ladies Pſalter the Name of God is changed into the Name of our Lady:</hi> ſo the Name of God into the name of Church, and the Attributes of God are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of the Church, as here, Infallibility, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering herein the Apoſtles deſcription of Antichriſt. <hi>That he oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped; ſo that he is as God, ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p>But to your Chapter. You might have done well (ſeeing the Church muſt come in firſt) to have defined to us what Church it is you ſpeak of, before you tell us of her Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; as, whether it be the Church virtual or repreſentative, or eſſential: did I know which you meant, I could ſpeedilier anſwer you; but ſeeing I do not, I ſhall ſhew the fallibility of each of them, leſt I ſhould happen to miſs of you. 1. Then; Infallibility is not a Jewel annexed to your Popes Crown. <hi>Lyra</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting on the words of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18 <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170001:27"/> the Faith; wherefore it conſiſts in thoſe perſons in whom is true knowledg, and confeſſion of faith and truth.</hi> Some of your Popes have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for Hereſie; as <hi>Eugenius</hi> by the general Council of <hi>Baſil;</hi>

Nor was he alone in this Hereſie, for it continued in the Church 600 years, as <hi>Maldonat</hi> obſerves.<note place="margin">Maldon, in Joan <hi>6.</hi> Concil.

It cannot be imagined how the Pope ſhould be free when the Church was ſo infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. Infallibility is not the inſeparable Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of the Church repreſentative, or a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel; for according to Papiſts it hath
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170001:28"/> no infallibility in it ſelf, but depends upon the infallibility of the Pope, which I have ſhewed to be a <hi>Chimaera. Azorius</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Azor. iuſtit. Moral. part. <hi>2.</hi> l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi> q. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>it's agreed upon by all Catholikes, that a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel may err in faith and manners, if it be not called and confirmed by the Authority of the Pope of Rome:</hi> And he inſtances in the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> of 600 Biſhops who erred with <hi>Arius;</hi> The Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of 300 Biſhops who erred with <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperor. This is the meaning of <hi>Lorinus</hi> as I conceive,<note place="margin">Lorin. in Act. <hi>15.7.</hi> p. <hi>583.</hi> Col. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> when he ſaith, Wiſe or <hi>learned men are to be conſulted with, but all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is in him alone.</hi> Now let any Papiſt ſhew any reaſon why in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil the Pope ſhould be infallible, and out of it ſhould be as other men. But Councils call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed by Popes, have with Papiſts themſelves been accounted fallible. The Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> was called by <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and had the Popes Legates ſitting in it, yet pleaſed not the Pope by their decree in the ſecond Seſſion, That the Pope ought to be ſubject to a general Council. This was alſo the decree of the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was called by <hi>John</hi> the 24. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Martin</hi> the 5, two Popes. 3. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170001:28"/> is not ſubjected in the body of the faithful: for it's a clear truth, which Dr <hi>Feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> obſerved, Whatſoever the Romaniſts ſay of the infallibility of the Church, they reſolve it at laſt into the Authority of the Church. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if we ſpeak of the univerſal viſible Church as comprehending all Beleevers in the world, it's not poſſible that all ſhould err, for then Chriſt ſhould want a Church: but for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, it's moſt evident they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto error; Papiſts profeſs it openly of other Churches, and ſometimes confeſs it of the Roman. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> decree to reform many things in manners and doctrine in that Church, and there was great need ſo to do. <hi>Caſſander</hi> ingeniouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth a defection from the primitive Church,<note place="margin">Caſſand.

From all this it's moſt infallibly true, that the Roman in none of their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is infallible. I will now come to examine his Arguments.</p>
               <p>Pag. 12. he begins with a ſuppoſition, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Suppoſing it for granted, that Chriſts know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Gods revealed Truth, and his power to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170001:29"/> convey the ſame to belief, raiſed his preaching and teaching to the full height and perfection of a Rule of Belief to the firſt Chriſtians; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon be denyed, he having communicated his ſaid knowledg and power to the Apoſtles, and in them to the ſucceeding Churches (as appears by his own words,</hi> Joh. 15. Joh. 20.) <hi>but ſhe may challenge a like intereſt and right in respect of after-Chriſtians: whence it follows, that all matters of Belief (as well other Points as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) are to be taken up upon her account and credit; and that whatſoever comes upon any other ſcore, is to be reputed Apocryphal, and no way appertaining to the obligation of Belief.</hi> In anſwer hereunto I will firſt conſider the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and afterwards the inferences and proofs of them. There are divers things herein queſtionable, if not ſimply falſe. 1. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Chriſts preaching and teaching was a Rule of Belief. Anſ.</hi> If by theſe acts you underſtand the <hi>materia circa quam,</hi> the matter of his preaching, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scripture or Word of God; then it's true that his teaching was the Rule of Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which he taught and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them was the Rule of Faith: but if you underſtand it of his tranſient preaching, as if by theſe acts he propounded to them a Rule of Faith (for ſo your words ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,) it's falſe; for Chriſt by his preaching did not propound a new Rule of Faith, but did
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170001:29"/> onely reveal that rule of Faith which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid, and was contained in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament. Hence it was, that Chriſt ſent his hearers to the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. and himſelfe did preach out of the Scriptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25.26, 27, 44. <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 4.16. and that for this end, as <hi>Beda</hi> notes, that he might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf to be the ſame that ſpoke in the Prophets,<note place="margin">Beda apud Lyran.</note> and that he might remove that ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceit, that there was one God of the Old, another of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yea further, Thus did the Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.22. they preached nothing but what was contained in the Law, and Pſalms, and Prophets. 2. 'Tis ſaid—<hi>was a Rule of Beliefe to the firſt Chriſtian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Anſ.</hi> And is it not a Rule of Belief unto us who are after-Chriſtians? Had the primitive Chriſtians one Rule of Faith, and we another? If there be one Faith, why not one Rule of Faith to all Chriſtians? why doth the Apoſtle exhort the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and in them all Chriſtians to walk by the ſame rule? <hi>In eadem regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lâ fidei; Phil.</hi> 3.16.<note place="margin">Gloſſ. interl.</note> If there were one rule, doth that bleſſing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. extend only to the Primitive Churches, and not rather to all Chriſtians who were to walk by the ſame rule that they walked? The teaching of Chriſt doth not make one rule, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170001:30"/> of the Apoſtles another, but both reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and explain one and the ſame rule of Faith. 3. Whereas you ſay, <hi>Chriſts knowledg of Gods revealed truth, and his power to convey the ſame to belief, raiſed his preaching, &amp;c.</hi> Pon might have done well to have explained what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and what power this is you ſpeak of, which is ſufficient to qualifie a perſon for propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rule of Faith: I conceive its requiſite (1.) that this knowledg extend to whatſoever Faith is to belief; for ſeeing the rule of Faith muſt be exact, containing neither more nor leſs then Faith is to belief; hence it will follow, the Propounder of this rule muſt know what is the adequate object of Faith. This univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſts knowledg is hinted in one of the Texts you mention, viz. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. <hi>All I have learned of my Father I have made known unto you.</hi> Here is firſt an univerſal knowledg, and then the propoſal of a rule ſuitable to this knowledg. 2. That this knowledg be moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible; no teaching can be a rule of belief, but that which is grounded on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible knowledg: conjectural knowledg may be a ground of opinion, not of Faith: Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.35. <hi>He that ſaw it bare record, and his record is true, and he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he ſaith true, that ye might believe.</hi> Now this infallibility in the ſubject knowing ariſeth, either 1. from the Divine Nature in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170001:30"/> the perſon: Thus the perſons in the Trinity are only infallible; and for this cauſe it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned Papiſts do deny, that our Faith is reſolved into the authority of the Church, and <hi>Azorius</hi> tells us, that in his time it was the common opinion of your Divines, that Faith was ultimately reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into God,<note place="margin">Inter Cathol. tres ſunt opiniones, una eſt aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentium primam rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem in quam fides noſtra ultimò reſolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur eſſe Deum reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantem quae ſunt fidei; Deus enim eſt prima &amp; ſumma veritas quaé falli ullo modo nec fallere poteſt, ac ratio credendi debet eſſe talis ac tanta ut ei falſum ſubeſſe non poſſit.

From imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpiration of the Spirit. Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired; ſo that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170001:31"/> in their delivering of the truth, they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>fallere nec falli,</hi> neither deceive, nor be deceived; this is taught by the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. The later of whom perſwades us, to give heed to the word of God, becauſe the holy pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of it were inſpired by the H. Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Again, for power which you leave unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, it may be obſerved, that there is a twofold power in order to this effect belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt. 1. Authoritative, which is his deſignation or appointment hereunto; this may be underſtood by that text you cite, <hi>As my Father ſent me, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Qualitative or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive, this is Chriſts <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the other is his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the one is his power, the other his authority. Again, this power is exerciſed two wayes: 1. By diſcoveries of the truth revealed to him: Thus its ſaid, <hi>All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you, Joh.</hi> 15.15. This is his outward teaching. 2. By commanding the heart to believe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to thoſe truths he reveals; this power is ſpoken of by the Pſalmiſt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> Chriſt doth command the ſoul to receive the truth, by ſtamping upon it a divine authority &amp; Majeſty, and withall by his Spirit diſcovering to the ſoul this authority and Majeſty ſo ſtamped upon it: This way doth Chriſt exerciſe his power in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170001:31"/> bringing the ſoul to cloſe with the Scriptures, as the rule of its belief.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I proceed now to your conſequence: <hi>He having communicated his ſaid knowledg and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Apoſtles, and in them to the ſucceeding Churches— but ſhe may challenge a like intereſt and right in reſpect of after-Chriſtians. Anſ.</hi> 1. You tell us of <hi>ſucceeding Churches,</hi> but leſt you ſhould ſeem to forget your dear Mother, or give other Churches liberty to claim equal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges with her; whilſt you talk of Churches, you neglect conſtruction, and come in with a <hi>She may challenge.</hi> 2. 'Tis falſe, that <hi>ſhe may juſtly challenge a like intereſt and right in reſpect of after-Chriſtians,</hi> as to the propounding of a rule of belief to them. For 1. There is no need of another rule for them, the rule that Chriſt propounded being ſuited to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and fully ſufficient and perfect, as your ſelf confeſs: If that Chriſts teaching hath the full height and perfection of a rule, <hi>i. e.</hi> be a compleat and perfect rule, what needs another rule? or can this other rule be higher then that which hath its full height? or have greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then that which is perfect? the perfection of Chriſts rule ſhews, that nothing can be added to it: If you ſay it was perfect as for the firſt Chriſtians, but not for after Chriſtians, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the ground of this diſtinction, for I am ignorant of it. 2. The ſucceeding Church
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170001:32"/> hath not communicated to her the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and power that Chriſt had, her knowledg is not univerſal; there hath been in every Age ſince your Churches Apoſtacy, an addition of ſuppoſed truths, which the former Age believed not. Your <hi>Pius</hi> 4. hath added ſome Articles to the ancient Creeds, as neceſſary to be believed unto Salvation, which formerly were not ſo impoſed, if once thought of; ſure then the Church before the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, either knew not the whole revealed will of God, and ſo could not by their preaching lay an exact rule of belief, or you propound a larger object then Faith will well admit. Again, her knowledg is not infallible, as I ſhewed in the beginning of this Chapter, the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath notoriouſly ſwerved from Primitive purity in their late Articles of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Creed: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, it cannot claim either of theſe means of infallibility which I mentioned before; the ſame may be ſaid of power, its not the ſame with Chriſt they want both his power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as I have explained them: Indeed if that which the ſucceeding Churches preach and teach, be the ſame that Jeſus Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preached and taught, then it is a rule of Faith to us; but thus, its not the teaching of the Church that makes it a rule, but its identity with the Scriptures, the marrow of Chriſts and the Apoſtles preaching. Thus the aſſertion is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170001:32"/> true, otherwiſe the Churches teaching without reſpect to Scripture is not a Rule, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed; and this is my Antagoniſts meaning, as appears by his next words, <hi>All matters of Faith, as well other points as Scripture, are to be taken up upon her account, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſequence, or rather the firſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ariſing from that, is in theſe words: <hi>Whence it follows,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>that all matters of belief, as well other points as Scripture, are to be taken up upon her account and credit. Anſ.</hi> 1. If by <hi>other points,</hi> you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand other points of Faith then are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, you take that for granted which is notoriouſly falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are points of Faith which the Scriptures containe not and conſequently that they are imperfect, and inſufficient to be a rule of Faith, and this is moſt falſe. For 1. Whatſoever was contained in the ancient Creeds, which were rules of Faith to thoſe Chriſtians that uſed them, that was all contained in Scripture; and more was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as neceſſary to be believed to Salvation: I deny not but your <hi>Trent</hi> Creed contains more then Scripture, even many Articles which learned men ſay cannot be proved but out of unwritten Traditions; but as it contains more then Scripture, ſo is it much larger then any Creed that was uſed before it; ſo that either their Faith was imperfect, having an imperfect
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170001:33"/> foundation, or yours is redundant tranſgreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bounds of a right and ancient rule. 2. The Scriptures teſtifie their own ſufficiency, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. I deſire you to conſider theſe two following Texts, <hi>Act</hi> 26.22. with chap. 20.27.<note place="margin">Lyran.</note> He had declared the whole counſel of God ſo far as concerned Salvation, and yet preached no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what the Scriptures did contain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. If you mean that we are to believe that the Scriptures are the Word of God, and that other fundamental points beſides this [The Scriptures are the word of God] are the truths of God, and to be believed, meerly becauſe the Church aſſerts it; ſo that the Churches affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them ſhould be the formal cauſe of our belief of theſe truths (as I ſuppoſe you mean) this I deny: For, 1. The Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in themſelves arguments that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a true Chriſtian, that they are the Word of God: Many notes are given by Proteſtants, which to you pulling them in pieces, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſingly, ſeem weak; which <hi>conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> or all together, have much ſtrength in them. He that reads the Scriptures with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually enlightened mind, cannot but confeſs, that never meer man ſpake like the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that fleſh and blood revealed not thoſe things to them which they declare, but God only. 2. Upon what account was this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170001:33"/> truth taken up by the firſt Chriſtians for the ſpace of three hundred years after Chriſt? they could not take it up upon the Churches account and credit, for your Authors hold, that its on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the power of Oecumenical Sinods to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine which are the Scriptures, and for this time there was no ſuch a Sinod called. The firſt Sinod that I finde delivering the Canon of Scripture, was that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> held about the year 364. Afterwards the third Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> both Provincial Sinods only, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed in a General Council. 3. Upon what account or credit doth your Church take up this truth, that the Scriptures are the Word of God: Sure you are ſo great an Enemy to Spiritiſts, that you will not think of extraordinary Revelations, or Enthuſiaſms; I hardly think that ever the Holy Ghoſt fell upon your Popes or Councils in fiery Tongues, or that they had either viſions or dreams; nor do I think that you will ſay, that your Church propoundeth the Canon of Scripture, meerly upon the ſuppoſal of former practiſe, that former Churches did allow and believe the Scriptures now received are Canonical, for this is only a teſtimony concerning matter of fact, in which 'tis confeſſed the Pope may erre through wrong informations: There may be ſpurious Canons foiſted into former Councils, like Pope <hi>Zozimus</hi> Canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170001:34"/> whereby he maintained his Supremacy; I therefore ſuppoſe that your judgment muſt be, that your Church aſſiſted by the Spirit, doth from internal notes of Scripture conclude the divine authority thereof. Hence 'tis that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils proceed by argument and reaſon, and there is an acknowledgment of the truth before they proceed to definition or Decree. Now if the Church take up Scripture upon this account, that ſhe through the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit diſcerns the notes and marks of Gods Word, why may not a Chriſtian by the ſame aſſiſtance diſcover theſe notes? and ſo believe that the Scriptures are Gods Word, upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the Church takes up this beliefe, though withal he doth, and ought to reverence and highly account of the judgment of the Church, or Paſtors of it, as that which hath a Priority, and is an occaſion of Chriſtians pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgment, and a confirmation of it; yet as I hinted before, it muſt not be denied that Chriſtians have a divine light in themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. which is for the diſcovery of divine objects, as natural light or reaſon is for the diſcovery of natural: This <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">

What I have ſaid of the Scriptures may be ſaid of other points of Faith, that they are not taken up
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170001:35"/> meerly or mainly upon the Churches credit, and account, but rather becauſe God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them in his Word, wherein they are therefore written, that we might have a ſure argument for our Faith. But I come to your next inference.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Conſequence or Concluſion: <hi>Whatſoever comes upon any other ſcore is to be reputed Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal, and no way appertaining to the obligation of faith.

Hence many of your learned men reject thoſe books as Apocriphal, which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> declared to be Canonical; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>All Scripture is by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration;</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170001:36"/> them, for the preſent I underſtand not what they ſhould prove, and therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs them without any anſwer.</p>
               <p>In your third Section you go about to prove the Churches infallibility, as a qualification of her for the delivery of a Rule of Faith, and you urge divers Arguments, which I now come to examine and anſwer.</p>
               <p>Arg. 1. <hi>God hath endowed her with inerrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, whereby to convey the truth ſafely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of miſcarrying, by arming her proof againſt all the enemies of truth, againſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance—error—darkneſs—weakneſs.</hi> For this you urge divers Texts. In theſe words, though they ſeem an intention of but one argument, yet there are theſe two, viz. 1. <hi>If the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convey truth ſafely, and without danger of miſcarrying, but by the gift of inerrability, then Chriſt hath endowed her with it: But ſhe cannot convey truth ſafely, and without danger of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying, but by the gift of inerrability:</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. 2. <hi>If Chriſt hath armed his Church againſt the enemies of truth, viz. ignorance, darkneſs, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and weakneſs, then hath he endowed her with inerrability; but he hath ſo armed her:</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. To theſe in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, to the firſt I anſwer: 1. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the conſequence of the major Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the reaſon of my denial is this, Chriſt hath not made the Church the principal, much
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170001:36"/> leſs the only means of conveying truth ſafely. Though yoor Pope, Cardinals, Jeſuites, Prieſts, yea General Councils ſhould err, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a ſafe way of conveying truth without miſcarrying, that is the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Beda</hi> paraphraſing upon thoſe words, <hi>In a dark place,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beda</hi> apud Lyran.</note> hath this note, <hi>In hujus ſaeculi nocte, &amp;c. In the night of this world full of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, vices and errors, where there is hardly one to be found without error, againſt which this light is neceſſary.</hi> So that you ſee the Scriptures convey the truth ſafely againſt temptations, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, errors, in the judgment of this venerable Author. It may be you will object, that infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is neceſſary for the Church, that ſhe may ſafely convey theſe Scriptures wherein the truth is: But I deny this to be true. For 1. It cannot be denied, but God did make uſe of the Jewes to preſerve the Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. yet by the leaven of their Doctors, the Phariſees, the Commandments of God were tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.5. Yea, it evidenceth their errability, that they miſtook the ſenſe of the Law, and when Chriſt came,<note place="margin">Mariana tract. pro e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. vulgát. cap. <hi>7.</hi> p. <hi>50.</hi>
                  </note> that they did generally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſiſt him; and yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scriptures, yea I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid the very <hi>iota</hi>'s and titles of them were preſerved from
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170001:37"/> miſcarrying. Your Authors confeſs of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text, that there is no ſubſtantial error in it. 2. The Law was by Gods providence kept ſafely a great while in the Houſe of the Lord, unknown to any, till <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the High-Prieſt found it in the daies of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.8. Now you will not aſcribe infallibility to the Houſe of the Lord. 3. You acknowledg not the Greek Church to be a true Church, yet the Scriptures have been ſafely preſerved by them, whileſt the error of the <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> and of thoſe who laid a neceſſity on Infants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Euchariſt, remained in the Church, which was for ſome 100. of years, yet then the Scriptures were preſerved from miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The truth is, Gods Providence is chiefly ingaged for the preſervation of theſe books, and that concurring, any means that God uſeth may ſuffice, though they were Turks and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that had the keeping of them.</p>

Your Prelates are no ſuch Pillars as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſtles, nor your Church ſuch a foundation of truth as theirs. Laſtly, ſuppoſing it were meant of the preſent Churches, particularly of the Roman: It's being called the Pillar and ground of Truth, doth not prove it's infallibilitie: <hi>James, Cephas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9.</note> and <hi>John</hi> were Pillars, yet who would infer from thence that they were infallible? <hi>Gerſom</hi> is by one call'd, <hi>Conſtantienſis Concilii columnam,</hi> a Pillar of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> yet he was not thought infallible. All that can be proved from theſe titles is this, that God makes uſe of the Church (both Paſtors and faithful people according to their places) to hold forth and preſerve the truth, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhhd in every particular Church, ſo long as it continues a true Church of Chriſt, but this doth not exempt it from ceaſing to be a true Church, or from erring. Thus it may truly be ſaid of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170001:42"/> 
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> that while they continued true Churches of Chriſt, they held forth and preſerved Gods truth; but neither this, nor thoſe were exempt from erring. <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie might have been truly called the Pillar and ground of truth, and goodneſs, holineſs, and righteouſneſs; yet <hi>Adam</hi> was created with a <hi>poſſe errare,</hi> a poſſibilitie of erring, as we know by woful experience.</p>
               <p>Your other text is <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. I anſwer. 1.

By Hell Gates the Fathers underſtand perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſins, and will you ſay that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the true Church cannot be perſecuted nor tempted to ſin, the contrarie is undeniable.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

What is more promiſed here then <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. where Chriſt promiſeth his preſence, and abode with private Chriſtians, even ſuch as love him, and keep his word, whom you account not unerrable. 4.

Its the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of the Word of God written, or the Scripture to be the ground of Faith. <hi>Theſe things are written that ye might believe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. <hi>20.</hi> ult.</note> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> that your Faith might have a certain foundation, revelations, or traditions, being more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and eaſily pretended where they have no exiſtence or being. Compare with this, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.19 Ye have a more ſure word of Prophecie, that is, <hi>In quo magis confirmetur au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor; whereby the hearer may be more confirmed.</hi> So that the word is more ſure, and that to us,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170001:44"/> inaſmuch as we are thereby more confirmed. Hence it is that our Saviour ſends his hearers to the Scriptures, that therein they might finde what they have to believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. So doth the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. and <hi>Abraham</hi> in the parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29. which your <hi>Lyranus</hi> comments thus upon,<note place="margin">Lyran. in Luk. <hi>1</hi> is. <hi>29.</hi>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17.10.11.</note> By this the <hi>Bereans</hi> tryed the truth of the Apoſtles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for its conformity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,<note place="margin">Annot. of Divines on the Text.</note> did receive it into their belief, 'tis ſaid; therefore many of them believed, <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scriptures: So that we may truly ſay, that if the Apoſtles had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing beſide, or contrary to Scripture, the <hi>Bereans</hi> would not have believed their preaching, and the Apoſtle himſelf would have juſtified them herein, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.9. On which Text <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath this note, <hi>Qui praeter—greditur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. apud Lyran. in</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. He that goes beſide the rule of Faith, doth not walk in the way, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from it—Neither would the Apoſtle himſelf
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170001:44"/> have us found our hope on him, but on that truth which he declared: That which was ſpoken by him was better, then he by whom it was ſpoken.</hi> From whence what can be more clearly infer'd then that. 1. The Word of God preached is the rule of Faith: And 2. That faith is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into perſons preaching the truth, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth preached by them, contrarie to both which is your minor Propoſition. 2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Suppoſing it true, that the Church muſt be the ground of Faith; yet I affirme that this is not yours, or any other preſent Church, but only the Primitive Church, which as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, is of greater authority then the preſent Church, which is in a kind grounded upon the Apoſtolike Church, or that Church which contains the Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp;c. All ſucceeding Churches are built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, whoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, becauſe of their viſible converſe with God and Chriſt, becomes <hi>efficax ad credendum,</hi> effectual for the grounding of Faith. Its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable, that whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> might have told the rich man, that his Brethren had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church to hearken to, yet he only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. 2. I affirm, that if your Church be a foundation of Faith, yet this would not be a Divine, but only an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith. And indeed this is the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why your Doctors commonly held, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170001:45"/> Faith is ultimately reſolved upon God himſelf revealing the truth (as <hi>Azorius</hi> obſerves) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Divine Faith muſt be reſolved into a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teſtimony, which the teſtimony of the Church is not, and they prove it by divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, eſpecially by foure, which I have tranſcribed out of <hi>Azorius:</hi> And though he do not altogether ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to their opinion,<note place="margin">Ratio: <hi>1.</hi> Eccleſiae teſtimonium eſt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem divinum ſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatione non per ſe &amp; ſua naturâ: at Dei teſtimonium eſt divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num per ſe &amp; ſuâ na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ, &amp; fides divina reſolvi debet in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium quod ſit per ſe non autem partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patione divinum. <hi>2.</hi> Quae ſunt fidei reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione Divinâ, non naturae lumine ſunt patefacta, at Deus eſt qui revelat ac pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit res fidei, non ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia. <hi>3.</hi> In Angelis, Prophetis, Apoſtolis &amp; caeteris Librorum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanicorum Scriptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus fides non reſolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, in eccleſiae teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, ſed in Deum per ſe pro xime revelantem: at fides noſtra eſt ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dem ſpeciei cujus fui illa.

Many learned Papiſts believe and teach, that it's onely an humane Faith, whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that this, or the other Pope is <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, and Chriſts Vicar on earth, becauſe it depends on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that this, or the other Pope, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and Canonically choſen to the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

The teſtimonie of the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> was an external motive to the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> belief, not the formal cauſe of it; ſo the preaching of Godly Miniſters, is a means whereby men are brought to believe, yet you will not conclude that Faith is built on them, and they infallible: It is the Church <hi>by which</hi> (as a means) not for which (as the formal ground) we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>Your fifth Argument is taken from the Churches compoſure and nature,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Arg. p.</hi> 18. 16.</note> in theſe words, <hi>Look on the Churches compoſure and nature, and her ſtrength will appear yet more, by reaſon ſhe is framed, and made up of men, Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>diſperſed and ſpread over the world, Act.</hi> 1. <hi>who by this means being of ſeveral Nations, Pſ.</hi> 11. <hi>different tempers and intereſts, Luk.</hi> 24. <hi>neither could, nor can meet, or conſpire to cheat themſelves or poſteritie with a lie.</hi> Which may be reduced to this Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm; <hi>If the Church be compoſed of men of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, different tempers and intereſts, then it's infallible; but it is ſo compoſed, &amp;c. therefore infallible. A.</hi> To your minor I ſhall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170001:46"/> onlie ſay, that if I were not otherwayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to believe it, then by your proofs of it, which are to be ſought like a Needle in a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Hey, I ſhould doubt of the truth of it: Sure you intended your proofs for your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholiques, who you know read not Scripture: But what needs all this ado, this ſenſleſs urging of holy Scripture to prove that the Church is compoſed of men, men of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations, different tempers and intereſts. But leaving this for your bruitiſh admirers to ruminate on, I deny the conſequence of your Major Propoſition, which is this, <hi>That ſociety that is framed, and made up of men diſperſed and ſpread over the world, &amp;c. is infallible.</hi> What Schoolboy that knows what infallibilitie is, would aſſent to this?

Are not the <hi>Mahometans</hi> men of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (yea more then true Chriſtians poſſeſs) different tempers and intereſts, yet damnable erroneous?

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170001:47"/> though kept aſunder one from another? Do you think they were infallible? The Arian Church was compoſed of men diſperſed over the world, of different tempers and intereſts, yet moſt dangerouſly erroneous: Yet further, when our Saviour ſuffered ſome of your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay the Church was only in the bleſſed Virgin; how would this your argument have proved the Churches infallibilitie at that time? Your citation of <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. and <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 11. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. would have been to no purpoſe. Once more, ſhall not the Antichriſtian Church having theſe qualifications, yet damnably err? 2.

               <p>J Cannot but wonder what your method ſhould be in this book, and how this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould come in next to the former. When you had ſpoken ſo much of conformity of faith to the Church, which you account as the firſt means of ſupernatural happineſs, what rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal man but would have thought, but that you ſhould have ſaid ſomthing of the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of hope to the Lords Prayer; which you laid down as a ſecond means, and not have leapt to the third in ſuch haſte. I could almoſt think that you are ſecretly proving adoration of that Roman Creature, the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for in your former Chapter you have been freeing her from Error, here you free her from ſin; for if any be free from ſin, it muſt be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170001:48"/> the Roman Church: And your next Chapter is about Religion, or religious worſhip: But ſeeing I have begun, I will continue to follow you. In this chapter you weave <hi>Penelope's</hi> Web; what you ſay in the firſt and ſecond Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you clearlie unſay in the third, which will therefore help me in anſwering your form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſſertions. You begin with exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, wondering that any can make queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the poſſibilitie of keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; But the ground of this your confidence is miſapplication of Scriptures, as I ſhal through Gods aſſiſtance make it appear in my anſwers to you. You urge Scripture, examples, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: The Scriptures you mainly urge are theſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. 1 <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>They are not above, but very neer us, in our mouths, and in our hearts to do them.</hi> Its the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of your Donatiſts, but makes not for you to prove poſſibilitie of perfect obedience; that which it proves is, the perſpicuitie of the Law, as to the Jews knowledg of it.<note place="margin">Vatab.

Theſe words do mainlie intend the words of Faith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8.) i. e. the application of Chriſts righteouſneſs to us by Faith. Thus <hi>Lyranus</hi> explains it, ſaying;<note place="margin">Lyran.</note> 
                  <hi>Oſtenditur, &amp;c.

If this were ſpoken only of the Law, his argument were frivolous, in that the Law of God is nothing eaſier to be done, by being before our eyes, then if it were far off:</hi> Moſes <hi>therefore in this Chapter, as in the fourth, doth commend unto the people Gods ſpecial good will (as appears by that place of</hi> Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 8.) <hi>in bringing them under his tutorage, which commendation could not be taken from the naked Law: Nor doth it hinder, that</hi> Moſes <hi>preacheth of ordering their life according to the rule of the Law, for the free righteouſneſs of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170001:49"/> Faith hath the Spirit of regeneration accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; therefore one is infer'd from the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the obſervation of the Law is through the Faith of Chriſt.</hi> This righteouſneſs of Faith is eaſie in regard of Law righteouſneſs, which was to be done by us, whereas it is rather ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us by Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.4. This is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by the Jews, who unanimouſly affirm, that this thirtieth Chapter belongs to the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> 3. If they be ſpoken of the Commandements, and prove that they may be kept, it remains yet to prove, that this keeping of them is an exact and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fulfilling of them, indeed to thoſe that are regenerate, the Commandements are ſaid not to be grievous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. but this is only becauſe they keep in them in ſuch meaſure, that God is pleaſed freelie to accept and reward them for it. 4. Theſe words are ſpoken to the people of the Jews in general, even to all, and therefore to each of them, amongſt whom there were many unregenerate.

This is moſt ſuitable to the context, for our Saviour is ſpeaking to poor ſouls, burthened with ſin, or the Lawes yoke, as your <hi>Gloſſe</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi> who calls the Law <hi>Onus patribus antiquis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portabile</hi>) ſpeak. Now can we think Chriſt ſhould ſend them to the Law again? This were to deliver up a poor oppreſſed ſervant to his rigid Maſter, which the Law forbids. Is it not rather more ſuitable to Chriſts temper to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them thus, Poor ſouls, the Law hath ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified you, by exacting of you perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or in caſe of defect ſubjecting you to the curſe: Come therefore to me, believe on me by a true Faith accompanied with love, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my perfect obedience for the covering of your diſobedience; look upon my ſtripes, ſee me become a curſe for you, and reſt upon my promiſe of application of my obedience to you; this is ſweet and profitable, whereas your own righteouſneſs is unprofitable, as to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170001:50"/> the acquitting of you from ſubjection to the curſe. (See this <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>init.</hi>) And though you meet with a burthen of afflictions and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, theſe are but light, and they work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glorie. 2. If it ſhould be underſtood of the Law, it cannot demonſtrate a facilitie of exact and perfect obedience: This is moſt difficult; ſo as its hard you ſay, to name any particular man that attains unto it; but of an inclination of the heart to, and an endeavour of obedience, this is eaſie to one that comes to Chriſt, the Apoſtle ſhews this in his own experience, ſaying; <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not, Rom.</hi> 7.18.

In the Law many things are commanded, which the Apoſtle ſaith cannot be done; in the Goſpel there is required the will —which alone may ſuffice, and be rewarded.</hi> Certainlie where Grace is, there is an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to good, yea a delight in the Law of God according to the inward man, yet there is no perfection.

But I denie that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them did ſo perfectly fulfil the Law, that they were able to ſtand the trial of Gods exact Juſtice: And therefore read the lives of the moſt holy men that the Scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and you ſhall find their blemiſhes and ſins, which are inconſiſtent with exact and perfect obedience. <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to be a man after Gods own heart, yet committed two mortal ſins (to uſe your word) Murder and Adulterie; <hi>Noe</hi> was a juſt man, but guiltie

This is fully propounded by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in anſwer to your Fathers the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> whoſe argument this of yours was: For ſpeaking of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> how they were blameleſs,<note place="margin">Aug. de Grat.

               <p n="3">3. Your Arguments now come to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of. The 1. is, <hi>Gods conditional promiſes to</hi> David <hi>and his Poſteritie, could be tearmed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then jeers, unleſs the Commandments were poſſible. A.</hi> I deny your conſequence: For 1. God may accept of that which man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; though he do not perform what he ſhould: You know <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> prayer occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170001:52"/> by a multitude of people that had not cleanſed themſelves, and came to eat the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over; <hi>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek the Lord God of his Fathers,</hi>

                  <hi>though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary; and the Lord hearkened to</hi> Hezekiah. Here was a defect in their obedience, and yet Gods acceptation and performance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to them, which was the benefit of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as <hi>Lyranus</hi> tells you: God did fulfil his promiſe to <hi>David</hi> and his Poſteritie, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> acknowledgeth — <hi>Who haſt kept with thy ſervant</hi> David <hi>my Faiher, that thou promiſed'ſt him;</hi>

The Falls of the Saints do not nullifie the Covenant of God, though ſomtimes they bring Gods Rod upon them.<note place="margin">

                  </note> I ſhould ſuppoſe that your ſelf hope for an accompliſhment of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet I hardlie think that you dream of yeelding exact and perfect obedience to Gods
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170001:53"/> Law, before you can obtain the promiſe. 2. God doth not jeer men by exacting obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they cannot yeeld: For 1. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing but what they owe him. 2. He requires nothing, but what he gave them once power to pay him. 3. He requires nothing but what Jeſus Chriſt is able to pay for them, and God therefore exacts it of them, that they may ſeek unto him on whom he hath laid help. This is clearlie taught, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.3.4. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David, ſaith God. But Jeſus Chriſt muſt be given, or elſe this Covenant cannot be ſure. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.4. a moſt plain text for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Argument is this. <hi>To what purpoſe is ſo much perſwaſion in books and Pulpits to live well, if the Commandments be impoſſible? Is living well, any other than keeping of the Commandments? It is aſſuredly as ridiculous, as impious, to term him a good liver, that ſteals, murders, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits adultery, &amp;c. A.</hi> 1. Thoſe perſwaſions are regulated by Gods command; God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands men to live well, which, as you ſay, is to keep the Commandments, and Miniſters in books and Pulpits perſwade men thereto. But to what purpoſe, ſay you, are theſe, if the Commands be impoſſible? I anſwer, it is to much purpoſe: As 1. To ſhew men what they ought to do. It's a noted Speech of that great
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170001:53"/> Anti-Pelagian St. <hi>Auguſtin O homo in praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione cognoſce &amp;c. O man in the precept know what thou oughteſt to have.</hi> You perſwade ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to joyn themſelves to your Roman Church, as the way to ſalvation, which its impoſſible for many of them to do, if you conſider ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods decree, or their ſtability. <hi>They ſhould deceive if it were poſſible the very Elect: but its impoſſible:</hi> thats implied. Now if we ask why you perſwade ſuch? I know no better reaſon you could render then this that you ſhew them what (according to your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) they ought to do. 2. To beat down pride and conceit of juſtification by works: whilſt we ſee that there is more owing to God than we can pay. This appears in the Apoſtles ſpeech. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I was alive without the Law once, but when the commandment came, ſin revived and I dyed.</hi> This the Law is a worker of fear and bondage, and a killing letter. 3. To drive them to Chriſt and the Grace of God through him. <hi>Propterea enim mandatur</hi> (ſaith devout Bernard) <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath enjoyned as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Commandments,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>that ſeeing our weakneſs and defects, and that we cannot do what we ought we might fly to the mercy of God.</hi> Thus the Law is a School-Maſter to lead us to Chriſt, making us ready to hearken to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170001:54"/> to lay hold upon his promiſes: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on that text. <hi>Math.</hi> 11.30. If this end were not in it I know not why it ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thoſe in an unregenerate eſtate to obey the commands, for its impoſſible they ſhould keep them as all except <hi>Pelagians</hi> will grant. 2ly. Whereas you ſay, <hi>Is living well any other then keeping of the Commands?</hi> I Anſwer, Living well, and abſolute perfect obedience to Gods Commands are not convertible. You ſay of many that they live well, but confeſs you cannot name one man that perfectly keeps the Commandments. It would be a harſh note if I ſhould tell you that I know not one Papiſt in <hi>England</hi> that lives well. Or if ſome Traveller ſhould affirm that he met not with one man in all Popiſh Dominions that he could ſay lived well. You are abundant in mentioning the good lives of Catholiques, and their holineſs of life is become a note of your Church. Sure you do not mean that Papiſts abſolute keeping of the Commandements is your Note. The truth is, he lives well who for the main of his life endeavours to conform himſelf to God, ſorrowing for his failings and inability to do what God requires, and flies to the mercy of God for the remiſſion of all the miſcariages of his life: he that lives thus, lives well, and if he dies, he dies well. Blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs before men ſometimes, yea uſually
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170001:54"/> denominates a good life. The perfect life wherein is no ſin is the life of Angels and Saints in Heaven, where there is perfection of knowledg and grace: This perfection the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aimed at, but confeſſeth he had not attained, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12.3. Whereas you ſpeak of <hi>tearming him a good liver that ſteals, &amp;c.</hi> I know not who aſſerts it, nor to what end you urge it. Its one thing to live directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and another thing to live according to the Law, though it come ſhort of Angelical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Argument is this, <hi>The juſtneſs of Laws that inflict ſevere puniſhments upon the breakers of the Commandments are n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t at all conſiſtent with the impoſſibility of keeping them: Neceſſity is a good and forcible excuſe againſt the ſtrongeſt charge.</hi> Suppoſing you to ſpeak of humane Laws: I anſwer, 1. No humane Lawes take hold of any for want of exact and perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: Exact obedience refers to thoughts, which human Laws reach not to, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or puniſh. 2. They ſuppoſe a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of outward conformity to them before men: this was in <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, who as touching the righteouſneſſe of the Law was blameleſs, but this was no more but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conformity, for he wanted grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by only your perfection is attainable. 3. What you ſay of neceſſity is vain, for 1. There
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170001:55"/> is no neceſſity of coaction whereby man might be forced to tranſgreſs the Law: the will of man is free from this neceſſity. 2. If there be any neceſſity to tranſgreſs, its contracted by our ſelves through our own fault, and therefore is not a good and forcible excuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtrongeſt charge. Do you think when God ſhall ask natural men at the laſt day why they did not keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that their neceſſity will be a good and forceable excuſe againſt Gods charge? And your ſelf cannot deny but that natural men as ſuch are unable to keep Gods Commands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you profeſſe Pelagianiſm.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Argument, you ſay, <hi>The very light of reaſon gives teſtimony to the Commandments poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, they being all grounded upon reaſon, and ſuited to her bent and inclination: the wickedſt man alive cannot ſay that he breaketh any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand without ſome ſecr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t check of conſcienco. Anſw.</hi> 1. What could <hi>Pelagius</hi> have ſaid more for his error? Doth not your argument prove his opinion? to ſay the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being grounded on natural reaſon, its in the power of nature to keep them, is the groſſeſt Pelagianiſme. 2. I will grant to you that the commandments are ſuited to reaſon as it was in its primitive purity, but not as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved. The Commandments therefore were not impoſſible to <hi>Adam</hi> in whom reaſon was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170001:55"/> pure and right, nor ſhould they have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to any of us, if we had ſtood innocent but now they are impoſſible to us, becauſe reaſon in us is depraved, and they are not ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depraved reaſon, there are neither few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nor eaſier Commandments given to us then to <hi>Adam,</hi> but the very ſame. If you ſay grace ſupplies reaſons defect. I anſwer, 'tis true that Grace doth reform Nature, but brings it not to its primitive purity: there is no man reacheth to that height of reaſon that <hi>Adam</hi> had, and to that conſonancy of it to Gods Law. <hi>Adams poſſe non peccare</hi> is in no ſon of man. 3. Whereas you ſay <hi>the wickedſt man alive, &amp;c.</hi> I queſtion the truth of it, when your Church through the hypocriſie of lyers brings in Doctrines of <hi>Daemons,</hi> forbids to marry and commands to abſtain from meats which God hath created to be received with thankſgiving of them which believe and know the truth. Do your conſcience check you? Are they not rather ſeared with an hot iron according to the Apoſtles prediction? Do wicked mens conſciences checks them for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought of their hearts that is evil. It may be, the commiſſion of the groſſe external act of theft, or adultery, or murder, and the like is uſually atended with ſome check in moſt men: but the commandments reach further then to the outward act, to mens thoughts and words,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170001:56"/> and geſtures, and few men will know that theſe are ſins; now there muſt be ſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſcience. 2. Suppoſe it true, all that it proves is this, that there are ſome footſteps of reaſon and conſcience in men, which we deny not: but it proves not that reaſon hath its perfection in them, or that the Law might be kept by them, though its probable that they might break it leſſe then they do. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20, 21.</p>

Reaſ.</hi> 1. There is a twofold impoſſibility, 1. Natural or ſimple impoſſibility when a thing cannot naturally be done. 2. Moral, when the thing is in its own nature poſſible; but there are divers intervening obſtructions which for the preſent make it impoſſible. 2. therefore I anſwer, things that are ſimply or naturally impoſſible are not to be endeavoured; we are not to endeavour to be Gods to make a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body without the quantity and qualities of ſuch a body, to place one body in two places, or two bodies in one, or as your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanc is to fly in the aire as birds (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps art might make this poſſible.) But if the things have only a moral impoſſibility, there is no queſtion but they may be endeavoured. And this way only are the Commandments of God impoſſible to us: they are not contrary

Hereby you tell us that your ſelf have performed a very hard work, for you have given us divers examples of particular men and women that have kept them. 2. You com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with old <hi>Pelagians</hi> whoſe anſwer you bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: for when they were bid to inſtance in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that kept the Commandments they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ſaid not who did but who might keep them: to which <hi>Hierom</hi> replyed <hi>Egregii Doctores, &amp;c.

                  <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> You are the poſterity of theſe Brave Doctors, and the ſame weapons that ſlew your Fathers will kill you. 3. The text you urge ſhewes only that by outward events none kows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he have the love or hatred of God, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward events coming alike to all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. <hi>But that all in general may keep them Chriſt himſelf aſſures it,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to be ſaved.

This aſſertion is as wicked as the other is vain. Can all in general keep the Commands? Is not faith a branch of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170001:58"/> Commandments? Yet the Scripture expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith of ſome that <hi>they could not beleeve.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 12.39.</note> Is it poſſible for reprobates veſſels of wrath to keep the Commandments? <hi>Aquinas</hi> in that place I lately mentioned ſhewes they cannot? How then can all in general? 2. The Text you urge as the words of Chriſt himſelf,<note place="margin">Aug. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir. c. <hi>103.</hi>
                  </note> do not prove any thing but that God would have ſome of all kinds of men ſaved, Kings, Private men, Noble, Ignoble, High, Low, Learned, Unlearned, as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounds it. 3. You falſly ſuppoſe that perfect perſonal obedience is the means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. If you had ſpoken of man under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works you had ſaid truth, teaching that as God wills mans ſalvation; ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as a neceſſary means thereunto that man in his own perſon ſhould perfectly obey Gods Commandments: But bleſſed be God who hath made a New Covenant with us through Jeſus Chriſt who is become The Lord our righteouſnes. 4. If this perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be the neceſſary means of ſalvation, then its not only poſſible that ſome may keep the Commandments but its certain that all that are ſaved do keep them, and then it were not ſuch an hard matter to name ſuch as have and do keep them. You that can Canonize Saints,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170001:59"/> can tell who are ſaved; your hope having the Keys of Heaven at his girdle can tell who goes in, and conſequently who hath kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> Our condition excludes capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of perfect obedience. <hi>Anſw. Its in the power of men to love God ſo far forth as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of their condition reacheth—this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to denominate, and render the ſubject it is in perfect. Reply,</hi> 1. The former part and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the main of your aſſertion is the ſame with what Proteſtants ſay againſt you. We ſay and profeſſe it that ſo far as the capacity of our condition reacheth, its in our power to love God, and hence we infer, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep the Law perfectly, becauſe we are in an imperfect condition our knowledg is but in part, and our love is no more. <hi>Adam</hi> could have loved God perfectly, for the capacity of his condition reached it, ſo ſhall we do in Heaven,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aquin.</hi> 12.9.109.</note> when that which is imperfect ſhall be done away: But its not thus with any man at preſent: regeneration is not perfect, there are ſeeds of corrouption as <hi>Aquinas</hi> confeſſeth. 2. The later part of your aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is clearly falſe, That power which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacity of our condition is not ſufficient to denominate or render the ſubject, it is in perfect or an exact keeper of the Law
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170001:59"/> of God. If a debter owe twenty pound, and hath but five pound, which he pays to his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor: doth the payment of this five pound (which is as much as the preſent capacity of his condition reacheth to) denominate and render him a perfect payer of his debt, I trow not, and pray Sir ſhew the difference betwixt this and your aſſertion.</p>

The proper act of Religion is to worſhip and bring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom only, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is defined by your Schoolmen and others: This worſhip is due to God only, and is that whereby we give up our ſelves unto God, as the ſupream Lord of all, and do place our hope
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170001:60"/> and that in him, as <hi>Azorius</hi> defines it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, faith is a part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, an act of Religion, but relating to God the ſupream Lord of all, not to the Church, which is only a ſervant under him, or if you will, an aſſembly of his ſervants, and indeed its reaſon that faith ſhould refer to God, it being the principal act by which a creature honours God, and therefore is more preſſed then any other Evangelical duty, and beſides its requiſite it have a ſettled object to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is Gods authority, for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es is not always viſible <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved, but his faith relied not upon the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The Bleſſed Virgins faith could not reſt upon any authority of the Church, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at Chriſts death, when your men affirm that the Church was in her only: but even then the Word of God, the material object of faith had a viſible exiſtence, and the fidelity of God faiths formal object was preſent with her to lean upon. The Scriptures you urge to prove that faith relies on the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (viz. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>John</hi> 14.) make nothing for you, the later ſpeaks only of the Diſciples inſtruction by the Spirit of God. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proves that we muſt beleeve the Goſpel, the material object of faith, but ſaith not a word of the Church: it ſaith not, he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon the Churches authority ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170001:60"/> Whoſoever beleeves the Goſpel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he receive it from the Church or not, ſhall be ſaved. I challenge you or any that dotes on the word Church, to give me any Scriptures that teacheth to beleeve in or on the Church: and think you not the Apoſtles knew how to ſpeak as well as you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have already ſhewed that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es authority is but humane in the judgment of learned Papiſts, and that the Spirits aſſiſtance makes her not infallible, nor a guide, or rule of belief. Your ſelf do in effect confeſſe at leaſt of the preſent Church, For you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 16. <hi>To be the guide of belief requires further ability and skill, to lay open immediately to belief Gods reveled truth, a prerogative belongs to the Church, and no other; as to whom alone revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made.</hi> Now this ability is not in the Church ſhe laies not open immediately Gods reveiled truth, whether hereby you mean that the Church ſpeaks to the heart the ſeat of faith, or that ſhe doth it not by means of the Scriptures: the Church lays open divine truths by the means of Scripture. Beſides the Church is not the ſubject of revelation which you ſay is the foundation of this prerogative. Your Logical proceeding in councels ſhew your want of reuelation. Your conſciouſneſs hereof makes you ſay revelation WAS, made it was, but is not ſo now.</p>

                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:170001:61"/>3. Your inference hereupon is, 1.

The Word of God revealed unto us by the light of faith wrought in the ſoul by the ſpirit is no humane reſpect: and this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians build their belief upon. 2. Inference: <hi>For them to deſerve the name of true Chriſtians, and to be ſtiled of the right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, their only way is to level at perfection, that takes its riſe from an abſolute reſignation of their wills to the will of God in order to the Church, which is to become ſpiritually little ones. Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Where do you learn that this grounding our belief upon the authority of the Church is the way yea the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the way to be true Chriſtians and of the right Religion. Are not thoſe Papiſts who differ from you in this point (and ſuch there are as I have ſhewed) true Chriſtians, and of the right Religion. I am ſure they are Papiſts for the main, and therefore cannot be of a wrong Religion if popery be the right. 2. Who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170001:61"/> told you that that Text of <hi>Matthew</hi> was to be ſo expounded. I have ſeen divers expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fathers on this Text different from yours; but I find not one that from it doth teach us to ground our faith on the Church, as the only way to true Chriſtianity and the right Religion. 3. Its a good leſſon to teach us to ſubmit our wills to the Will of God: but it doth not appear that we ſhould ground our faith upon the Churches authority: the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are altogether ignorant, and deſtitute of expreſſions of ſuch a duty.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the unity of Religion.</head>
               <p>JN the beginning of this Chapter you aſſert that True Religion is <hi>One,</hi> but preſently fal upon the unity of perſons in this one Religion, and to the means whereby they come to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, which means you propound in theſe words; viz. <hi>Experience ſhews that this unity of Religion is an effect of acknowledging the Church for the rule of belief, it being viſible to the eye that all that ſquare their belief to the Church are one in religion; whereas they that take to themſelves other rules diſcent and jarre &amp;c. p.</hi> 28. <hi>Aſw.</hi> 1. Whether thoſe who
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170001:62"/> acknowledg the Church for the rule of belief, be ſo one in Religion, as that they neither diſſent nor jarre, I refer it to any mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who hath but ordinary inſight into the writers of Popiſh controverſies. I wonder whoſe experience it is that finds it? Or what Alſeeing eye it is that diſcerns All acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgers of the Churches authority to be one in Religion. Have you ſeen All Papiſts? If you have, are mens judgments and thoughts viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the eye? Or did they all write their judgments, and give you them that your eye might ſee them? But I ſhall confute this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. 2. Why do you vary your phraſe: for firſt you ſay this unity <hi>is an effect of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>g the Church for the rule of belief.</hi> And then as thinking you had miſſed it you ſpeak of actual <hi>ſquaring mens belief to the Church.</hi> There is a great difference betwixt theſe. A Papiſt may acknowledg the Church to be the rule of faith, yet through ignorance of what the Church holds or ſome other cauſe, he may not ſquare his belief to the Church. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells me that many Papiſts in theſe parts acknowledg the Church to be the rule of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; yet its hard to find one that doth not in ſome point or other, differ from the Church: I have found many that in ſome points diſſent from her. <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Catharinus</hi> who were both preſent at the <hi>Trent</hi> Council could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170001:62"/> what was the Councils meaning in the points of Original ſin and juſtification, but wrote one againſt the other of thoſe ſubjects. So that though both of them might acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Church to be the rule of faith, yet they could not both ſquare their belief to the Church, unleſſe ſhe be a maintainer of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrines. 4. May not experience carry it as much for the Scriptures, and ſhew that they are the rule of faith, for its moſt certain that all that ſquare their belief to the Scriptures are one in Religion. Thus the primitive Chriſtians did ſquare their belief to the Scriptures, and were unanimous. Its mens leaving the Scriptures and building upon their own fancies, or building their faith upon changable, and unſtable men that makes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions and jarring. The Word of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always the ſame, there cannot be diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where is conformity to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You give a reaſon hereof ſaying, <hi>Of which no other reaſon can be given, but that the Church is alwaies conſtant and certain; other rules ſubject to uncertainty and change. Anſw.</hi> 1. What mean you when you ſay that the Church is always conſtant and certain? is it in regard of exiſtence, I grant it of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, but deny it of your <hi>Roman</hi> Church.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170001:63"/> there will be the Church ſtill. I know no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you have that your Church ſhall always continue: there is much in Scripture to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the contrary. Or, 2. Is it in regard of holding and manifeſtation of the truth, but this way it hath not been always conſtant. Time was when it was <hi>Arian</hi> under <hi>Liberius,</hi> and the Orthodox grievouſly perſecuted in it: time was when it adminiſtred the Lords ſupper to Children even for 600 years: Time was when the Bible of <hi>Cleme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Again, Sometimes it hath happened that the Church could not, would not, or durſt not manifeſt the truth: Where was then its certainty?

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Spirit of Spiritiſts.</head>
               <p>WHen I had read this Title and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it with the Title of your tenth Chapter, I thought Spiritiſts and Proteſtants had noted two diſtinct kinds of perſons: But the matter of this and the next Chapter ſhew, that in the language of the beaſt they are the ſame. Its ſtrange you bring not in Scripturiſts, and Chriſtians, they are equally ſtrange to you who glory only in the name CATHOLIQUE: but why do you uſe theſe names. Is it that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſts you tell the world (though againſt your minds) that in your contention with us, you are Anti-ſpiritiſts, Anti-ſcripturiſts, Anti-chriſtians, which is your name given you in Scripture. In your Chapter after a ſubtile diſtinction betwixt the ſpirits virtue which you ſay is in all, and the effects of it, which are confined within narrow limits, you come to ſhew who they are that have the gracious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Gods Spirit or his favour in them, in order whereunto you ſay—<hi>To know and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern who they be, the only way is to ſee their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170001:65"/> warrant, and examine their works. If their warrant prove that of miracles, and their works good, doubtleſs they have the favour of Gods Spirit; if otherwiſe, they are at the beſt but pretence-makers, and uſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How, or upon what ground you diſtinguiſh warrant from works as marks of Gods Spirit, I know not, this is a warrant for my belief, that I have the Spirits favourable preſence with me, becauſe I have good works which cannot proceed from any other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And hereby Chriſt and St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as you ſay) taught us to try men by, and it ſtands with reaſon upon thoſe accounts that you give. Yet, 2. Its falſe that they that want miracles have not the favor of Gods Spirit. Amongſt all the marks of a reprobate or enemy to God I do not find want of miracles to be any: nor is the having of miracles a ſign of one pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirits favour; have all your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques the gift of miracles, or have none of them that want it the favour of Gods Sp rit? You had need to arm them with a cordial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle againſt this uncomfortable doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay further Are all your Popes workers of miracles (if we ſhould ſuppoſe their works good) I have read of the miracles of many of your Saints, but I find little of the miracles of Popes. Monks and votaries carry away the bell for miracles, and dare you ſay your Popes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170001:65"/> have not the favour of Gods Spirit? Laſtly Sir, are your ſelf and companions workers of miracles? If you be, pray what are they? Can you drink poiſon and not be hurt (why then did not your Monk of <hi>Winſtead</hi> Abby live after his potion?) Can you tread upon ſcorpions, and they not ſting you? Can you ſpeak with ſtrange tongues which you have not learned? Can you raiſe the dead, make the lame to walk, and the blind to ſee? I know not that any of you claim a power of doing theſe. Your pretence of caſting out devils is a Jeſuitical deluſion of poor credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ideots, as I ſhall perhaps hereafter ſhew. 3. I ſuppoſe your meaning is this, they that hold their doctrine to be true (which truth of Doctrine is an effect of Gods Spirit) muſt prove it by good works and miracles; ſo as that Doctrine that is not thus confirmed is falſe Doctrine, as you aſſert in your next ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this is alſo untrue. For, 1. Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are not abſolutely neceſſary for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Doctrine, or of their calling who deliver it. Unleſſe, 1. That which is taught be ſuch as cannot be believed without miracles, in regard of the ſtrangneſs and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. Such was that Doctrine or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Jeſus the ſon of <hi>Mary</hi> was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah promiſed, that the Jewiſh eccleſiaſtical policy ſhould ſee altered. The ceremonial
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170001:66"/> Law ceaſe and that ſuch and ſuch events ſhould happen in after-times, theſe were our Saviours and the Apoſtles Doctrines, and being ſuch as I have ſhewed, they needed confirmation by miracles. 2. Unleſs thoſe who Preach pretend to extraordinary inſpiration and miſſion: thus the Apoſtles and Prophets (though not all of them) ſhewed their extraordinary calling by miracles. 3. When the Goſpel began to be firſt planted, and a Goſpel Church gathered out of the World, which did not acknowledg the Scriptures for true, and therefore needed conviction ſome other way. Hence 'tis that miracles were common in the infancy of the Church, but are not ſo now. <hi>Sedulius</hi> (upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. where 'tis ſaid,<note place="margin">Sedul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> apud Lyran.</note>

If Spiritiſts (for I uſe your own word) and you agree about the rule of Faith both in it ſelf and in reſpect of us that it is Gods revealed truth, and the ſame truth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to us: Why then do you entitle your Chapter <hi>The Spiritiſts rule of Faith?</hi> as if we had one rule of Faith, and you another:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170001:70"/> whereas you aſſert that the difference is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the rule but the expreſſion of it. You explain the difference thus, <hi>Spiritiſts hold that the rule of Faith is Gods reveal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. For your opinion, I ſay, 1. What mean you by Gods revealed truth? I perceive you underſtand not the Word of God revealed by the Prophets and Apoſtles in Scripture, for you ſeem to blame us for our expreſſion of Scripture only, and accordingly oppoſe the Scriptures ſufficiency in your next ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How comes it that the Spirit of God hath no place with you in expreſſing the truth of God? Muſt your <hi>Diana</hi> ſhoulder out the Scripture and the Spirit too? The Spirit is much beholding to you for your opinion. Are you not Antiſpiritiſts in this your doctrine, and clearly deſtitute of the favourable effects of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hath the Scripture no uſe or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with you but to come in and bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the Church is true? Doth it not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Gods truth as much as for your Churches truth? Is it not the teſtimony of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170001:71"/> the Lord Jeſus? But as the thing <hi>Church</hi> is the Pillar of Truth, ſo the word <hi>Church</hi> is the very Pillar and Prop of Popiſh Errors, and therefore you uſe it <hi>uſque ad nauſeam.</hi> 4. Are not you like a turning mill-horſe, or like the wicked in the Pſalms, <hi>(Impii nmbulant in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitu.)</hi> You ſay the Scripture is the Rule of Faith (at leaſt partial) as the Church expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that is expoundeth it, and if you be asked how you know the Church expounds it right, you anſwer, by the Scripture which bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Churches truth. The Scriptures bear witneſs to the Churches truth, and the Church bears witneſs to the Scriptures truth. But your tenet is ſo clear with you (though moſt groſſe and wicked) that you add no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it but what ariſeth from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ours as you have delivered it. Therefore, 2. I come to defend ours againſt you, but firſt I will lay it down in other tearms, 'tis this, we ſay that the rule of divine belief is the Word of God contained only in Scripture, the means whereby we underſtand it is principaly the Spir t of God which enlightens our minds and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Your ſecond Text I have formerly anſwered. 3. Your third Text <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> underſtands of bringing men from the eſtate of death and deſtruction into the eſtate of life and Salvation, ſubjecting
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170001:72"/> them to Chriſt. Your gloſs, by <hi>All under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> conceives is meant all proud conceited perſons who are made ſubject to the faith of Chriſt which they had before reſiſted. 4. Your fourth text ſhews (if it be any thing to our preſent purpoſe) that the Spirit and your Roman Church are two Maſters that cannot both be ſerved, and therefore its not ſtrange you have oppoſed the Spirit whilſt you have ſtood for your Churches intereſt. But Sir, know that the Spirit of God and the true Church are not contrary Maſters; much leſſe the Spirit of God in private perſons, and the ſame Spirit in publique Miniſters. The Spirit of God is in the Church and in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and reall member thereof, revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to each according to the capacity and need of every member.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You affirm concerning the Scriptures <hi>that the Scripture is deficient,</hi> which you prove by Scripture and by Reaſon. 1.

You attempt to prove it by reaſon, ſaying, <hi>reaſon makes it good, becauſe it declares not all points that Chriſtians are bound to believe, which they acknowledg themſelves bound to beleeve. Anſw.</hi> 1. I could bring many teſtimonies to prove that Scripture is a rule, your ſelves grant it to be a rule, when you call it Canonical, with excluſion of other writings: now its no rule if it be not perfect, for the rule that faith requires ought to be as full and ample as the duty of faith. 2. The Scripture aſſerts that whatſoever we are bound to beleeve as neceſſary to ſalvation to be beleeved, is contained in Scripture: that noted place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: the abundant utility ſhews its ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to inſtruct any to ſalvation: that ſpeech of <hi>Biel, Quomodo anima ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>

But I come to your inſtances of points of faith, which Scripture declares not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Inſtance</hi> concerning Scriptures. You ſay <hi>they declare not that thoſe books of Scripture which are received for Canonical are ſo indeed; that ſome are Canonical, other ſome Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal; that they are determinately theſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nſw.</hi> 1. They do declare that thoſe books which are received for Canonical by Proteſtants are ſuch, and the Apocryphal books are not ſuch. For, 1. One part of Scriptures gives teſtimony of another. The New Teſtament bears witneſs of thoſe books that go under the name of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Pſalms, again they give teſtimony to the New Teſtament. Yea the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth bear witneſs to it ſelf that it is the Word of God, haveing thoſe intinſecal notes whereby it may be known: thus it is with the book of the creatures which ſets forth the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power, and goodneſs of God, and is therefore a witneſſe thereof. Now if it be asked whence it appears that this is a witneſſe? it muſt be granted that it appears by that order which is in the Creation together with the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170001:74"/> profitableneſſe and uſefullneſſe of all things in their places. The harmony, conſent, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al profit, &amp;c. of Gods Word in Scripture doth evidence that it is Gods Word and ſacred Scripture. If it were not thus that Scripture gave teſtimony of it ſelf, how doth the Church it ſelf know Scripture to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? She cannot plead Enthuſiaſme, and the humane teſtimony of Fathers is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for infallibility.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. All things are written by the Apoſtles which are neceſſary to be beleeved by all men,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de ſuffiſ. ſcript. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> (theſe are <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words) but to beleeve the Scriptures to be the Scripture is neceſſary for all men (ſay you) therefore it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that its written by the Apoſtles that the Scriptures are Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. By way of retortion: I pray Sir how do you know that this or the other is the true Church, for this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known in as much as all opinions depend upon his teſtimonies. The ſame way that you ſay the Church may be known, even by it ſelf, the ſame way do we know the Scriptures, they give evidence to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. The exact knowledg of what books are Canonical is not abſolutely neceſſary to be beleeved. I deny not but the knowledg of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170001:74"/> Gods Word is thus neceſſary, and this may be where that knowledg is wanting. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally be denyed that Chriſtians for ſome hundred years after the Apoſtles did know the Word of God yet wanted exact knowledg of what books were Canonical, nor was the knowledg of them judged neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Inſtance,</hi> concerning the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both: You ſay <hi>The Scripture declare not that the Jews Sabboth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2ly. If you conſider the form or compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, that the Apoſtles made it, each one of them addding an article to it, this is not neceſſary to be beleived being but grounded on humane fallible teſtimony.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, In the cloſe of your Chapter you bring an argument to prove that Spiritiſts do not make the Scriptures a rule of their belief, 'tis this, <hi>Were Scripture the rule of their belief, though it contain divers truths, yet thoſe truths meeting and becoming one in revelation, they wo ld all perfectly agree, not only Lutherans amo g themſelves, Zuinglians among themſelves, Calveniſts among themſelves, but likewiſe Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans

For 1. All have not the ſame meaſure of knowledg whereby they ſhould underſtand exactly every point in Scripture, many things are Scriptural by conſequence which muſt be found out by argument, and are hardlier underſtood than other things. Though in ſome places of Scripture a Lamb may wade, yet in others an Elephant may ſwim. The Apoſtle ſaith, Let us as many as be perfect be thus minded, &amp; if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheleſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame rule &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15.16.

All have not the ſame meaſure of grace, and freedome from corruption and paſſions, which prevail to draw men from a conformity to the ſame rule. Some are of a croſſe, and peeviſh temper, ſubject to a ſpirit of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, maintaining errors, leſt they ſhould ſeem to be overcome by others, or not to have been ſo ſound as others are.

You reject clear expoſitions of Scripture becauſe we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them. When <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Sacraments ſaith, <hi>fuerunt, &amp;c.</hi> they were divers in the ſigns, but alike in the thing ſignified, grounding his ſpeech upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Maldonate</hi> anſwers —<hi>I am perſwaded if</hi> Auguſtine <hi>had lived in our age he would have thought otherwiſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perceiving the heretical Calviniſts to be of of his opinions.</hi> And he further adds, <hi>I rather approve my own expoſition than that of</hi> Auguſtin,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170001:77"/> 
                  <hi>becauſe this is more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the Calviniſts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mald. in Joan. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> 2. Your ſelves acknowledg one Rule the Church, yet cannot truly ſay that all Papiſts do perfectly agree. I ſhall ſhew the contrary hereafter. 3. Though Proteſtants differ about particular truths, yet they all agree in this, that whatſoever God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals to them in Scripture they are bound to beleeve it. Herein Lutherans, Zuinghans, and Calveniſts (as you name them) do fully agree. 4. You falſly and ignorantly ſuggeſt to your ſeduced followers, that the Proteſtant Churches are full of diviſions and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Calveniſts differing amongſt themſelves and from Lutherans &amp;c. Sir I pray you read the harmonious confeſſions of Proteſtant Churches, and if by them you be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of error, in your next give us ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues of thoſe divided and ſub-divided dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences you generally mention, till then we ſhall ſuſpend our belief of you.</p>
               <p>Your reaſon in theſe words, It being the property of unitie to unite &amp;c. is a piece of non-ſence: If you had mentioned Rule inſtead of unity, it had been moſt true, but nothing to purpoſe. It is the property of a rule to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and make one all that conform to it. So that to the making up of this unity there muſt not only be an exact rule, but a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170001:77"/> to it in them whom it doth concern: which perfect conformity canot be yeelded by any living man to the Word of God, becauſe of ignorance and corruption which remain in the very beſt of men.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of your Argument needs no anſwer, the Premiſes being overthrown. What you ſay of our doing homage to <hi>Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi>'s fancy, is ſimple and falſe. You know we abhor a blind obedience, and an implicite faith. The books our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple read ordinarily, are not <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Zuinglius</hi>'s works, but the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by which we examine all writings, even theirs you now mention, if we meet with them. We look upon <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> as eminent lights in the Church of God, not as Gods. We ſay not <hi>Dominus Deus noſter Calvinus, &amp;c.</hi> as ſome of you have ſaid of your Pope. We acknowledg them indued with the Spirit, but not infallibly inſpired, as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers forth of an old light, hid under a Romiſh buſhel, not as introducers of any new one, as reformers, not innovators. We reverence them as pious men now with the Lord, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray to them, nor keep holidays for them: our homage we do is neither to men, nor their fancies, but unto God himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Proteſtant Church</head>
               <p>AFter an unconceivable diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Proteſtants and Spiritiſts, is <hi>Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Zuinglians, Calviniſts,</hi> in the firſt words of this Chapter, you tell us <hi>That this Chapter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to lay open the many ſhapes Proteſtants put their Church into, to make her paſſe for true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſhapes you lay open are not <hi>many:</hi> 'Tis true you mention five, but there are two diſtinct ones only to which al the reſt may be reduced (<hi>viz.</hi> lawfull Paſtors and true Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The ſhapes (as you call them) of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, or the notes of the truth of their Church, as themſelves propound them are not many, but very few.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. You lay not open what Proteſtants they are that form theſe ſeveral ſhapes, that ſo your Reader might examine them himſelf, and ſee what they ſay for themſelves, and whether you deal candidly with them in reporting their opinions. Your diſhoneſt dealing with Gods Word, makes us ſuſpect you deal no better with men.</p>
               <p>Before I come particularly to the ſhapes, I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170001:78"/> ſhall premiſe (for the Readers information) that there are ordinarily two only notes whereby Proteſtants prove their Church true; <hi>viz.</hi> the pure preaching of Gods Word, and the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments, to which ſome few add as a third, the uſe of right Ecleſiaſtical Diſcipline. But this man, as if he had known nothing of Proteſtants judgment, or had no mind to encounter with them in their way, wholly omits the plea of right ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, and brings the other but in the laſt place, ſpending the moſt of his Chapter about perſonal ſucceſſion of Biſhops; thinking himſelf (probably) beſt able to encounter with us in this point, both becauſe of their bead-roll of Popes, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts general conceit that there were no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Paſtors in the World before <hi>Luther</hi>'s days, which is alſo this mans miſconceit ſo far as I know. But I ſhall do him the favour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his five ſhapes to the former of our notes, ſuppoſing him to ſay as <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stap. princ. doc. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That the preaching of the Goſpel is a very clear note of the Catholique Church, ſo it be done by lawful Miniſters.</hi> The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then is concerning the lawfulneſs of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which is aſſerted and confirmed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divers times in which it hath been queſtioned and contradicted particularly in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170001:79"/> the days of <hi>Luther,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memory together with the times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding them. Notwithſtanding I will follow you in your method, viewing the ſhapes and your anſwers to them in that order wherein you propound them.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SHAPE I.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PRoteſtants are a company of Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of Biſhops and Paſtors, that have power and authoritie from Chriſt, and his Apoſtles to adminiſter the Sacrament, and preach the Word of God. but ſuch a companie is the true Church, therefore Proteſtants are the true Church.</hi> To which you anſwer, <hi>Neither Chriſt nor the Apoſtles confer'd any power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie on Proteſtant Biſhops and Paſtors, they were dead and gone long before theſe had any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: to give power and authoritie requires pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the giver, &amp;c. Rep.</hi> 1. The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is ſandy, its not univerſally true that to give power and authority requires the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the giver, for it may be otherwiſe, eſpecially in two caſes. 1. If the giver ſhall deliver ſome rules or directions for perſons receiving power, &amp;c. a perſon after his death by his will or teſtament gives power to another to be his executor. A King by his Patten, (though himſelf be perſonally abſent) gives
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170001:79"/> power and authority to his Commiſſioners, who therefore acts by the Kings authority. Your Popes derive not their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from any but from <hi>Peter,</hi> every Pope profeſſeth he hath the keys from <hi>Peter,</hi> that is by <hi>Peter</hi>'s will or teſtament, or ſome directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rules of his, for he is not (I know) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent when the Pope is ordained. 2. If the prime-giver do inveſt ſome perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him, with power to give the ſame unto others his ſucceſſors: A King doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt a Town or Juſtices of peace to ordain a Conſtable or ſome other officer in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit. Its the Kings power that inveſts him in his office, and by oath he promiſeth fidelity to him, yet the King is not preſent, but as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by his miniſters. Should I upon this ground infer that neither your preſent Pope, Cardinals, Prieſts, Jeſuits, no nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church hath any of its power from Jeſus Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, what could you ſay to it? If you grant it, you prejudice your Church for whatſoever ſpiritual power is not from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, is uſurped &amp; tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical: if you deny it, you cauſe an earthquake in your argument, ſhaking yea overthrowing its very foundation that <hi>to give power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority requires preſence of the giver.</hi> For Chriſt is not now preſent with your Pope, &amp;c. as God was preſent with <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 3. Or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170001:80"/> Chriſt with the Apoſtles, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. To ſay they have a mediate preſence will not ſerve your turn, for you require perſonal preſence like that <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. and <hi>Math.</hi> 28. where God and Chriſt did confer power immediately, by themſelves, and not by others. To apply this to our purpoſe, by way of reply to your anſwer, I ſay, Proteſtant Biſhops and Paſtors have their power and authority from Chriſt both thoſe ways I mentioned. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. By deed and teſtament, Thus Chriſt by himſelf and Apoſtles in Scripture authorize thoſe who are qualified with gifts and abilities for the Miniſtry to exerciſe their gifts, which they may do upon ſome occaſions, and in ſome times, even without a ſolemn inſtallment by Biſhops and Presbiters, as when God doth caſt them amongſt a people where the Goſpel hath not before come, or where Presbyterial ordination cannot be had in regard of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wickedneſs of ſuch as have power to ordain, or where Paſtors are few and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ſervice of Chriſt in his Church. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe and ſuch like occaſions that reſpect each one ſhould have to the promoting of Chriſts Kingdom puts him (ſo far as God qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies him for it) upon the exerciſe of this duty, provided there be not a contempt, or wilfull neglect of that tryal of theſe gifts which Chriſt hath committed to the Miniſters of his Church
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170001:80"/> whom he hath alſo intruſted with the power ordination of thoſe who are gifted. Thus it may be ſuppoſed to have been with <hi>Apollo</hi>'s <hi>Acts</hi> 18.24, 25, 27. and you read of divers perſons preaching whoſe ordination is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned thus, though we ſhould grant you that our firſt reformers had no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary exernal calling, yet had they their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Chriſt, being by him furniſhed with inward abilities (which ordination is but a ſolemn reflection upon, and an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of.) You confeſs that <hi>Luther</hi> was a man of learning and parts. <hi>pag.</hi> 47. <hi>Surius</hi> affirms of <hi>Bucer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sur comment. in An. <hi>1526.</hi> p. <hi>152.</hi> An. <hi>1531.</hi> p. <hi>214.</hi>
                     </note> that he was <hi>non pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum doctus,</hi> not meanly learned. The Epitaph, this ſame Author mentions to be written upon <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius</hi> ſhews him to be a man of great learning the reſt of them were men of good parts, and indued with a Spirit of zeal for Gods truth: beſides, with thoſe gifts the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity did much concurre, thoſe who had the key of order neither entring in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor admitting others into it who ſought the advancement of Chriſts Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By meditation of others who received authority from the prime-giver, thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Biſhops and Paſtors after the Apoſtles time received their power from the hands of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170001:81"/> thoſe whom the Apoſtles had before inveſted therewith; yea if we ſpeak of the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Biſhops and Paſtors they had their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority immediately from the hands of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. The Waldenſes who had Biſhops and Paſtors amongſt them are ſuppoſed by ſome of your ſide to have continued from the Apoſtles &amp; upon this account are judged more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you than any other Sect. But to omit them:<note place="margin">Rainer. de vit. &amp; morib. Waldenſ. apud <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher. de aec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. Chriſt. ſucceſſ. &amp; ſtat. p. <hi>151.</hi>
                     </note> The firſt and ancients Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church were Proteſtants in their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. You have been often challenged to ſhew that the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church for many hundred years after Chriſt were not Proteſtants, but Papiſts maintaining the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of your Late Creed. It were eaſy to ſhew that thoſe Doctrines of Proteſtants that you anathematize as hereſies were with the ancient Fathers received truth, thus were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under both kinds, prayer in a known tongue &amp;c. by your own confeſſions. Its therefore falſe that the Apoſtles were dead and gone long before theſe had any being. So then, we have power and authority from Chriſt by meditation of others, ſucceeding the Apoſtles. But againſt this I have ſaid you object thus,</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:170001:81"/>
                  <p>Object. <hi>By this is implyed a continuation of ſucceſſion in the Proteſtant Biſhops and Paſtors, ever ſince Chriſt and the Apoſtles; it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable any other way how power could be tranſmitted from one hand to another, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is not implyed a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſucceſſion, &amp;c. if thereby you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch ſucceſſion as admits of no interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in particular Churches. The ſucceſſion of Paſtors in particular Churches may ceaſe through the violence and tyranny of enemies, yet the violence being over, there may be a reeſtabliſhments of the Miniſtry, and that in ſucceſſion to the former, though the means of the new eſtabliſhment be only the peoples choice, which in ſome caſes is moſt valued.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. What if there hath been a continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſucceſſion in the Proteſtant Biſhops, &amp;c? You anſwer, <hi>They muſt then be viſible, for as much as it was their parts to preach the Word of God, and adminiſter the Sacraments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> I grant it, who ever denyed that the Paſtors of the Church were viſible? We hold indeed that ſometimes they may lie hid from their enemies, but they are viſible to their friends: though they be not ſeen in the ſtreets of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are viſible in the mountains and woods, &amp;c. when the Church is in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170001:82"/> her Paſtors are not viſible in Cities and Courts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But what if viſible: You anſwer, <hi>If vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they may be produced, they ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: they may, becauſe that power is vain and fictitious that is not reducible to act,</hi> Mat. 5. <hi>They ought, becauſe Biſhops and Paſtors in caſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie are to give an account of their calling, Luke</hi> 7. <hi>as well to ſettle the wavering, as to bend and make ſupple the ſtifneſſe of ſtubborn misbeleevers,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. They might be viſible in their times, yet now not producible.

                  <p n="1">1. Your reaſon is a piece of nonſence, and having no relation to what it ſhould prove,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170001:82"/> the queſtion is about the power of naming them, not the actual naming them, if we had granted the power and denyed the act, your <hi>Say</hi> had made ſomewhat for you, as when you ſay the Commandments may be kept, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not name one that keeps them, it makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its a tautology, your word <hi>Reducible</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes power not act; ſo that its as if you had ſaid that power to act is vain and fictitious, that is not in power to act.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Your quotation is impertinent ſo far as I know I have ſearched <hi>Math.</hi> 5. and I find not any thing that may make for your purpoſe and I'm ſure your axiom is not there. Sure you miſtook <hi>Matthew</hi> for <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Its falſe, that there is a neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Proteſtant Biſhops and Paſtors, we look more at ſucceſſion of doctrine then perſons, and think this ſufficient to denominate us the true Church, for which we have <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s judgment (in that book you even now cite) affirming <hi>That thoſe Churches which are able to produce none of the Apoſtles or Apoſtolical men for their firſt planters are notwithſtanding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical for conſent of faith, and conſanguinity of doctrine.</hi> When our Authors bring in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues of Proteſtant Paſtors it is to ſtop the mouths (it may be) of unreaſonable men that demand them of us. Your reaſon to prove
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170001:83"/> this neceſſity is this, <hi>Biſhops and Paſtors in caſe of controverſie are to give an account of their calling.</hi> For, 1. It's one thing for a Paſtor to give an account of his calling, and another thing to give an account of his predeceſſors. If you were a Biſhop in ſome City, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the lawfulneſs of your calling, were the way to give them a beadrol of your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in that City? This would come ſhort of giving ſatisfaction, for they might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shepherds, and you who ſucceed them no better than a ravening wolfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. The Text <hi>Luke</hi> 7. proves nothing for you, if you point at the account our Saviour gives of his calling to <hi>Johns</hi> Meſſengers, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. You ſhall find no naming or producing of his predeceſſors, but of his Doctrine, and works. <hi>Go tell John</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what ye have ſeen and heard.</hi> So we, when you demand how we prove our ſelves true Paſtors, ſend you to what you hear and ſee, our Doctrines and works conformable to the Word of God, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. Few that have a deſire after truth, and regard our Doctrine, will waver becauſe of ſuppoſed want of ſucceſſion, and for ſtubborn miſ-believers, the proof of ſucceſſion will not bend, or make them ſupple, they that will not believe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets ſpeaking in Scripture, would not believe though one
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170001:83"/> ſhould riſe from the dead, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. But to what purpoſe bring you the Text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. there is nothing in it for ſucceſſion in order to the bending of the minds of miſ-believers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you underſtand the wives being in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their own husbands (whereby they that obey not the Word, may without the Word be won) to be the wives proving their Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſucceſſion. But for the neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſucceſſion, you urge teſtimonies and reaſons, which I ſhall now in order exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>The teſtimonies are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, <hi>Bidding the Sectaries of his time let him ſee the beginning of their Church, and unfold the order of their Biſhops and Paſtors.

                  <p>To this Teſtimony of <hi>Hierom</hi> you add a reaſon to prove that derivation of ſucceſſion is proper to the true Church, ſaying <hi>Its evident in it ſelf; by reaſon the true Church was planted and eſtabliſhed before any falſe began—therefore muſt need be a</hi> non plus ultra, <hi>a ſtop and bar betwixt whatſoever counterfeit Church and Chriſt to keep off the like continuation of ſucceſſion.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it be ſo evident in it ſelf, why do not all Papiſts agree with you, but rather oppoſe you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your reaſon is moſt ridiculous, 'tis this, The true Church was before any falſe one, therefore ſucceſſion is proper to the true Church. If you had been ſpeaking of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, your argument would have had ſome force in it, but antiquity and ſucceſſion are different things, conſtituting two diſtinct notes of your Church. Antiquity properly points at the beginning of Churches, ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only at the continuation of them. But I think your mind was upon antiquity, for in your fifth Section you purpoſely handle it; and your meaning here is this that falſe Churches cannot derive their ſucceſſion to the firſt foundation thereof which is Chriſt, for you ſay, <hi>There muſt be a ſtop and bar betwixt whatſoever counterfeit Church and Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Heretical Churches as ſuch cannot derive
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170001:86"/> their ſucceſſion from Chriſt, or the Apoſtles for then they ſhould derive their Hereſies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. But, 2. Thoſe Churches that are now, or have lately been Heretical, may yet derive a perſonal ſucceſſion from Chriſt, in as much as at firſt they were planted and eſtabliſhed in the truth by the Apoſtles; but have ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated: Thus it is with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and your <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and probably was with the <hi>Arians,</hi> who though they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doctrinal ſucceſſion, yet might have perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal there being Biſhops of note who maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Hereſie. In the former regard its true which you ſay, that the <hi>Arian</hi> derivation climbeth no further then <hi>Arius,</hi> there's a great difference betwixt ſucceſſion of Doctrines and perſons, though you ſeem to take no notice of it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. I confeſſe the Authors you mention do ſeverally attribute divers errors to them, but theſe witneſſes agree not amongſt themſelves. <hi>Guido Carmelita</hi> chargeth them with ſaying that Maſſe is to be ſaid once only every year. <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> contrarily ſaith, that they hold that the Prieſt may conſecrate at any time, and miniſter to them that require it.

Though they ſhould not hold in all points with Proteſtants, yet they might be Proteſtants: perfect complyance is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to conſtitute a perſon, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church. Many of the members of the Church of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, &amp;c.</hi> did not agree in all points with thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, yet were members of them. The French
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170001:88"/> Papiſts go under the name of Catholiques, yet agree not in all points with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for they deny the Pope to be above a general Council, and that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was Oecumenical and Lawfull.

                  <p n="2">2. For your Minor. 1. Its verified of their adverſaries, the Authors you mention, as I have particularly ſhewed. 2. There is

                  <p n="2">2. You anſwer, (ſuppoſing them Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants) <hi>There was a great diſtance between them and the Apoſtles, in which they could not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; foraſmuch as they were not begun, or were quite extinct.</hi>

If you ſpeak of them as to their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the reformed Religion, not confining your ſpeech to thoſe particular perſons, but extending to all that profeſſed the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with them, then there is no diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Apoſtles, as I ſhall ſhew when I come to your fourth Shape.</p>

                  <p>But you bring us in objecting, <hi>Luther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Epiſcopal power immediatly from God.</hi> To which you anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>Such a power being extraordinary is always accompanied with that of Miracles, as appeared in Moſes, Exod.</hi> 3. <hi>And the Apoſtles Act.</hi> 2, 14. Luther <hi>never wrought Miracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> For any thing I ſee this might have made another Shape for its independent on this,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170001:91"/> you lead us, as the Devil our Saviour into the Wilderneſſe to be tempted, but as he evaded the Devils, ſo we ſhall do your temptations. We ſay then. 1. A power received immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God is not always accompanied with that of Miracles. The Prophets were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediately by God, ſo was <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and probably <hi>Phillip</hi> the Deacon, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.14. and the men of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene, Act.</hi> 11 Yet all of theſe were not inveſted with power of Miracles. It was ſo with our Reformers, they did not work Miracles, nor (as you ſay) did pretend to that gift. Yet had they ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimonies of their calling, as their true Evangelical Doctrine, ſeconded with the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their lives, and the wonderfull ſucceſs of their Preaching. Theſe did evidence their divine calling.</p>
                  <p>You object—<hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>drawing ſo many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him maugre the Pope, Emperor, and other Potentates, ſhews only a ſtrange itching in men after novelties. and proneneſſe to libertinage.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>in a ſhorter ſpace led away far more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I ſpeak not of his ſucceſſe only, or by it ſelf but as accompanied with truth of Doctrine and an holy life, and this doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a lawfully called Paſtor. Thus it was not with <hi>Arius</hi> or any other heretiques who have been erroneous in their Doctrine, and profane in their lives, or elſe ſucceſſes, or if they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170001:91"/> have had ſucceſſe they have but been ſhort lived with it, none of which can be affirmed of <hi>Luther</hi> or his adherents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I deny that <hi>Arius</hi> was more ſuccesfull than <hi>Luther,</hi> there is a great diſproportion betwixt them herein. For, 1. <hi>Arius</hi> had not that oppoſition that <hi>Luther</hi> had. <hi>Arius</hi>'s oppoſers were no inquiſitors nor cruel Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, nor curſing Popes, nor cut-throat Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, but a milde Emperour and ſome modeſt Biſhops; the weapons wherewith he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted were meek exhortations, perſwaſions, entreaties, not bulls, curſes, racks, tortures, that holy age knew no ſuch Eccleſiaſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. The French Hiſtorian gives this account of Proteſtants perſecutions.<note place="margin">

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:170001:92"/>2. <hi>Arius</hi> did not ſet himſelf againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an uſurping lordly power, which might have procured him hatred and revengefull op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but <hi>Luther</hi> did, whoſe two vices, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> told <hi>Fredrick,</hi> were that he touched the bellies of the Monks, and the Crown of the Pope.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Arius</hi> his hereſy was not conſtantly maintained and ſtuck to; <hi>Arius</hi> recanted and ſubſcribed the <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed as did others his followers: but <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was conſtantly maintained by himſelf and followers without any recantation or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit compliance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Arius</hi> his hereſie did not ſeem croſſe to reaſon, but rather conformable, but <hi>Luther</hi>'s did croſſe carnal reaſon, the ground of Popiſh hereſies. In theſe regards, <hi>Luther</hi> might more truly becompared with the Apoſtles than <hi>Arius.</hi> And indeed his Doctrine (though you are pleaſed to ſlander it as <hi>being acceptable and pleaſing to the depravedneſſe of Nature,</hi> and ſo contrary to the Apoſtles Doctrine) is the very ſame for the ſubſtance of it that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles taught, being no way contrary to mortification of wills, religious faſting, chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the like. And therefore it was not <hi>itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after novelties, and pronneſſe to libertinage,</hi> that drew many after him, but a deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation both of Doctrine and Diſcipline,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170001:92"/> which were exceeding corrupt in the Romiſh Church, whereof very many were ſenſible, and under which they groaned, waiting for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and this is that which a great Papiſt ſaith—<hi>Neither did Luther in this age come forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Divers Popiſh Catholiques in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, were Proteſtants in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths,</hi> and theſe might have an hand in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations afterwards.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. If you admit this, it will follow (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your principles) that there is perſonal ſucceſſion, and conſequently a true Church <hi>inaſmuch as derivati n of ſucceſſion is ſo proper to the true Church that it cannot agree to any falſe as St. Hierom in Nucam.</hi> 1. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth,</hi> Sir you remember the words, they are your own, <hi>page</hi> 41. but <hi>oportet mendacem eſſe memorem.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. True Religion is not to be meaſured by mens meaning, but by the Word of God. So then if according to Gods Word proteſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm be the true Religion, its no great matter what your Catholiques Biſhops meaning be.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Catholique Biſhops ought to ordain men in order to the ſetting forth of the unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8.

If your Biſhops ordain men to preach any thing elſe, they are abuſers of their power, their ordination is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and unlawfull and ſo far to be fruſtrated. Thus our Proteſtant Biſhops and Paſtors that have been ordained by you retain that which is pure, <hi>viz.</hi> power to preach the word, and adminiſter the Sacraments, but reject that which is evil in your ordinations; we retain the power which is good and from God, but reject thoſe circumſtances of yours which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company

In derivation of ſucceſſion its not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that thoſe we derive from, agree in all points with us; If it were, I know where your ſucceſſion from <hi>Peter</hi> would be, you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to name one Biſhop that for above 1000 years after Chriſt did agree in all points with you Sometimes the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church who have the power of ordination may be corrupt, holding ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which the ordained may be free from, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether, or in ſome meaſure, or if not when they are ordained, yet afterwards. Now what rational man can queſtion the calling of thoſe who are thus ordained?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We can ſhew a derivation of ſucceſſion, though not without ſome interruption of Biſhops from Chriſt and his Apoſtles profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main points of the Doctrine of the Church of England. I deny not but there might be differences in leſſer points, but theſe could not nullifie our claim to them, nor make that they ſhould not be called Proteſtants. Your rule therefore is not a very good one that Doctrine being in Nature much like unto number, the leaſt addition or Diminution al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering its kind, and grounding a new deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.

There is no Church can claim exemption, The Popiſh Church hath had thoſe in it whom you call lyers and innovators and upon that ſcore have come into your <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatory judices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. You aſſert that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which never any but <hi>Novatus</hi> and his followers did attribute to the viſible Church, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>all faire,</hi> without ſpot or wrinkle (a priviledge belonging to the Church as triumphant or but imperfectly agreeing to the true members on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the viſible Church in this World) and herein you ſhew your ſelf to be none of that ſociety of Chriſtians <hi>who generally maintained &amp; profeſſed that their commiſſion and power was to

                  <p n="2">2. You take that for granted (which we conſtantly deny) that your <hi>Romiſh</hi> Synagogue is the true Church and all fair and without ſpot or wrinkle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Proteſtants are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and innovators, which you are yet to prove. 3. Yet granting both theſe for Argument ſake, I affirm that maintainers of falſe Doctrine may be in the Church, without all that danger you talke of while they lye hid, and conceal their opinions, and whilſt the Church doth what ſhe can to caſt them out of her: Theſe would be a plea for your Church, if the ſuppoſition were true: But you urge further thus. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, Biſhops and Paſtors, if mingled with Catholiques, did neither beleeve nor profeſs their Doctrine; but only concealed and covered their own, for fear of the formidable rigour of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; and ſuch could neither be true nor make a ſaving Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not true becauſe the miſſion of true Biſhops and Paſtors, being founded upon perſecution and ſuffering, Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.) <hi>it is proper to them to fear no Colours, nor make up a ſaving Church, by reaſon profeſſion of faith is neceſſary to Salvation, Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Repl. 1. It muſt not be granted that Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Paſtors did meerly conceal and cover their own Faith and Doctrine: there was much crying out againſt errors and diſorders in the Popes Church by many, though not without
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170001:97"/> ſufferings. <hi>Gerſom,</hi> for ſpeaking freely againſt the diſorders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his goods and dignities by the Pope, and expulſed the Univerſity by the Sorboniſts, <hi>Laurentius valla,</hi> was exiled by the Pope. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Veſalia</hi> a preacher at Worms, was ſharply handled by the inquiſitors, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing indulgences, auricular confeſſion, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, Merit, <hi>&amp;c.

Its not ſimply unlawful, nor altogether unſuitable to the true ſaving members of the Church to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal or hide the truth: Confeſſion is a duty, but the precept binds not <hi>ad ſemper;</hi> there are ſome caſes wherein its not neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

When by our profeſſion there is no hopes of doing good, or bringing any advantage to the truth, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. Thus Proteſtants might conceal the truth, when they ſaw their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was not advantageous to the Truth, or the Salvation of thoſe with whom they were, although when brought before authority they did ſtill profeſs it, and dye for it. 3ly. They

You miſtake the cauſe of their concealing the Truth, which was not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting and a diſtruſtful fear, which looks mainly at torments as you imagine; but their fear was a ſober fear. 1. Leſt the Church of God ſhould be deprived of them, by reaſon of their profeſſion of truth at ſuch a time when there was no viſible advantage accruing to it. 2.

He perſwades us to flee, not as if it were evil to ſuffer perſecution, nor that we ſhould fear death; but he would not have us authors, or abettors of evil, either to our ſelves, or him that perſecutes, or him that kills us; for he warns us that we be cautelous: but he that obeys not, is audacious and raſh, and unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſts himſelf, upon manifeſt dangers; now if he that ſlays a Man of God, ſins againſt God,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170001:99"/> he alſo is guilty of this murder who doth not avoid perſecution, but through audacity offers himſelf to be apprehended; for in as much as in him lies, he helps on the wickedneſs of the perſecutor:</hi> Otherwiſe, our Proteſtant Biſhops and Paſtors, have as couragiouſly profeſſed the truth and for it undergone with patience and conſtancy, as great torments from Popeiſh hands, as ever any in any age of the world did: So that were you not blinded with rage againſt Proteſtants you could not but bluſh to charge them with fearfulneſs of profeſſing the truth. For a concluſion of this: I deſire you look home to your Engliſh Prieſts, thoſe Hedghogs, whoſe appearance is mainly in the night and in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who are ſo far from a voluntary and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profeſſion of their faith, that I do not know of any one that ever ſuffered upon this account, <hi>viz.</hi> the open and publike profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his faith, though they pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guarded with power of miracles, which might make them more valiant. 5.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Its the ſame of private men and Biſhops and Paſtors in this caſe: Its a falſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel (ſpeak of whom you will) to ſay they are not named, therefore never were. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec</hi>'s Parents are not mentioned, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had none, yea thouſands of Popiſh Paſtors and Biſhops are now unmentionable; for I ſuppoſe you cannot reckon up all the Biſhops and Paſtors that have been in every Country, Town and Village ſince the <hi>Roman</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:170001:100"/> Church had its beginning (as you ſay in the Apoſtles) yet you would not like the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if I ſhould therefore conclude there were no ſuch Biſhops or Paſtors in ſuch places. The inſtance that is given in the Shape will not be nullified by your diſtinction of publique and private perſons; for the perſons menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned are publique perſons, men of Renown and famous, ſuch as Hiſtories ſometimes make mention of, and you have no more but Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to enable you to count your Biſhops.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your proof is moſt idle, and fitter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure laughter then an anſwer; 'tis this, Chriſt hath promiſed to be with his Church to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. therefore all Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops and Paſtors for 1600. and odd years paſt, may be mentioned and named: Gallant Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here is no aſſureance of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of viſibility. Chriſt is with his Church when ſhe is hid in the Wilderneſs, the <hi>Rehmiſts</hi> acknowledg it: yet at that time ſhe ſhall be hid, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.6. inhabiting in Mountains and Dens and Caves of the Earth, as <hi>Andreas</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it aſſure perſonal viſibility its not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, but ſucceſſive, not of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170001:101"/> for ever; but of a ſucceſſion of perſons, who in the ſeveral ages wherein they live, ſhal be viſible: The Apoſtles, nor their ſucceſſors for 1500 years, are not now viſible, 'tis ſo with our Biſhops and Paſtors, in their times, wherein they lived, they were viſible to their friends at leaſt, though they might hide it from their perſecutors. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is this to our naming of thoſe who have profeſſed the Apoſtles doctrine ever ſince their time, is this in the promiſe? or is it a neceſſary dependent on the Churches viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in ſucceeding ages? you cannot for ſhame ſay it, leſt you condemn your ſelves whoſe Catalogues are of Popes not all inferior Biſhops and Paſtors, who notwithſtanding have as much intereſt in that promiſe as any Pope, if not more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>Biſhops and Paſtors are Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and Limbecks, if theſe ſhould be at any time clouded and in obſcurity, Chriſt would be worſe then his word, his doctrine fall ſhort, and not come home to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You ſhoot very far wide of the mark: we are ſpeaking of the naming of thoſe that we confeſſe had a real exiſtence, and you are proving a neceſſity of their exiſtence. Are entity and nomination reciprocal, ſo as while you prove one, you prove the other alſo?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doth their being Aqueducts and Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becks prove that they may all be named? You
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170001:101"/> may as well demand the names of all the pipes or troughs whereby waters have been convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch a place for 1000 or 1600 years; and ſay this is neceſſary becauſe they are pipes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though all Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church ſhould be corrupt, and ceaſe to be true Paſtors of the Church, as it was in the Jewiſh Church when our Saviour came,<note place="margin">Occh. dial. p. <hi>1.</hi> l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>28.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>Viſibility is not peculiar to Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops and Paſtors, but neceſſity of viſibility is Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men in this way of viſibility being contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently viſible.</hi>

Your diſtinction is excellent, but I wonder you miſſed telling us of being viſible Archipodialiter and reflexive which would have ſuited you as well as this of neceſſary and contingently. Are not private perſons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily viſible as well as publique? Doth not viſibility agree to corporal ſubſtances, and that neceſſarily? If private perſons be but contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently viſible, then they are ordinarily inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and conſequently Spirits, unleſſe their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility

                  <p n="2">2. Your inſtance of whiteneſs in fowls is ſimple. For whiteneſſe is not common to all fowls as viſibility is to all men. As you ſay, there are ſwans therefore white, or there are biſhops therefore viſible, ſo may you as truly ſay they are men and therefore viſible, but what is all this to the meaning of Biſhops and Paſtors though we ſhould grant what you ſay for viſibility?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. For men to be viſible after death is ſomething accidentall and withall ſtrange unleſs to a popiſh ear, or a necromancers eye, but ſuppoſing charitably, that you mean that their names ſhould be viſible. I ſay, 2. There is no neceſſity for evidencing a true Church that the names of all preceding Biſhops and Paſtors thereof ſhould be mentioned. Its ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that it be ſhewed that their Doctrine had its riſe from Chriſt, and that the Apoſtles profeſſed and preached it. Thus we ſhew the truth of our Church againſt your Antichriſtian Temple. Its a truth ſubſcribed to by all that the Doctrine which had its riſe from Chriſt, and was profeſſed by the Apoſtles, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it in all ages, and theſe muſt needs be true Paſtors, though without exact ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Your ſelf formerly did confeſs that it is required of Proteſtants to deduce a ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, not of men meerly ſent, but withall profeſſing the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine maintained in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though now (forgetting what you had before ſaid) you affirm that if Biſhops and Paſtors be found ſucceeding each other without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170001:103"/> its euident they are true and Catholique, but this I have confuted before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Your reaſon with its compariſons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, do not prove your aſſertion, you ſay—<hi>It not providing the Church of means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and make good her right in caſe of oppoſition —the queſtion of the Churches right is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided not unlike that of two great men laying claim to a principality by vertue of ſome pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſcent from a certain Prince.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is unlike, if by diſcent you mean a ſeries of perſonal ſucceſſion without interruption. For the Churches right is not decided that way Scribes and Phariſees might have lineal deſcent from <hi>Aaron</hi> yet be theeves and robbers, <hi>John</hi> 10.8 The Churches plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince the Apoſtles days could not have this lineal diſcent from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, yea the Churches planted by the Apoſtles might have their <hi>Hiatus.</hi> Yet both theſe later be true Churches of Chriſt. You ſeem to grant (<hi>pag.</hi> 56) that the Biſhops and Paſtors of ſome particular Churches cannot be named in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſucceſſion. How then will you prove the truth of thoſe Churches, for it cannot be proved by this means you plead for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſing them like, yet its not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedneſſe of ſucceſſion, for which they lay claim to the principality (for it may have been in the hands of uſurpers) but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170001:103"/> together with the qualifications required in him, who is to inherit, which are found in one, but not in the other: thus it may be ſaid of the Church whoſe diſcent from Chriſt together with her qualifications, <hi>viz.</hi> inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with true Doctrine and right adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments according to the will of Jeſus Chriſt doth entitle her to the inheritance of truth.</p>

Tracing it is not always a ſure way; it may be mingled with other waters as have not their riſe from that mountain, it may run through a dead ſea, and then you may be at a loſſe whilſt you ſeek an uninterrupted deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it from its head. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I grant that when the head is near, and there is no mixture of impure and different waters, your courſe is very good, thus the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who lived within a few years after Chriſt, and before heretiques came into Biſhopricks and Paſtoral Churches, did make uſe of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſucceſſion. But the caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170001:104"/> with us, we living many hundreds of years after them, and there having been heretical Biſhops in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, You ſay, <hi>The truth of Doctrine is diſcernable much after the ſame manner, if it be found to have no way varied, but to have kept its own from Chriſt and the Apoſtles, doubtleſs its Orthodox, if not, moſt certainly its new and falſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The former part is moſt true, but not the later, that Doctrine is true, which though it have been varied in particular Churches yet at preſent is the ſame with the Apoſtles Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Granted is true, what will become of your preſent Church and its Doctrine which you confeſſe is not the ſame with Chriſts and his Apoſtles Doctrine, certainly it will follow that your new articles of communion in one Kinde, prayer in an unknown tongue &amp;c. are new and falſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>You anſwer, 1. <hi>True Doctrine is no mark of a true Church, it being often to be ſeen among
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170001:104"/> ſchiſmaticks who for want of communion cannot make a true Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. The profeſſion of the Apoſtles Doctrine delivered in Scripture is a mark of the true Church as not agreeing to any other, which I prove by theſe arguments drawn from your own aſſertions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True Doctrine is the <hi>Churches inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mate. p.</hi> 40. But it could not be her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable mate, if it could be ſeperated from her, and brought into ſociety with a ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ hath entruſted his Church with trueth, and ordained her keeper and preſerver of it, and what comes upon any other ſcore, than upon the Churches account and credit is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Apocryphal and no way appertaining to the obligation of belief.</hi> p. 13. Therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Doctrines are out of the true Church are not truths. For that which is beleeved by men out of the Church comes not upon the Churches account, and therefore with you is Apocriphal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. True Doctrine is <hi>Her (the Churches) Doctrine,</hi> p. 51. Therefore cannot agree to others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>There is no agreement betwixt the Temple of God and idols, no concord with Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial.</hi> You urge theſe words to prove that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of error cannot be in the Church, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170001:105"/> it will as ſtrongly prove that profeſſors of truth cannot be out of the Church, where then is your truth agreeing to a ſchiſmatical Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Doctrine being in nature much like unto number the leaſt addition or diminution altereth its kind and groundeth a new denomination</hi> p. 50. Now you cannot name any number of ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks that did not either adde to, or dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſomething of the Doctrine which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles taught in Scripture, hence 'tis that both <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> tell us that there is no ſchiſme which doth not invent different Doctrines, and new hereſies. Seperation from a Church cannot but ſuppoſe a different judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them that ſeperate. The Donatiſts whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings in to prove your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument go under the name of heretiques, and did indeed hold doctrines different from the Apoſtles Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>To theſe arguments grounded on your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions I will adde two more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Papiſts themſelves urge conſent of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine with the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and ancient Church, a note of the true Church, this is <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s ſixt note, but it ſeemes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts may make that a note of the true Church which Proteſtants may not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Doctrine (ſay ſome of you in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to us) is the form of the true Church;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170001:105"/> therefore (In inferre) it cannot agree to any falſe one, the form being intrinſecall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that which it doth inform, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to others: as Rationality cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of beaſts, ſo neither can Profeſſion of the true Apoſtolicall Doctrine agree to a falſ and unſound Church according to your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But you urge two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doctrine is as divers as there are divers ſeeming Churches: and ſo not affording any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate notion draweth in opposition of a mark of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The queſtion is not whether do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine indefinitely be a mark of truth (as you propound it) but whether true Doctrine that is, the doctrine of the Apoſtles clearly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Scriptures, and profeſſed by Chriſtians, be a mark of the true Church, we affirm it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though Doctrine in generall be divers, yet true Apoſtolicall Doctrine is not divers, but one and the ſame: as there is one Lord, one Spirit, one Church; ſo is there one faith, which the Scripture reveals unto us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Doctrine ſuppoſeth Biſhops and Paſtors, as the means whereby it is conveyed to us,—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it importeth as much to name Biſhops and Paſtors before, may be given to mention Doctrine as it is neceſſary, paſſing from one extreem to another to touch firſt the middle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:170001:106"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But that your memory is weak, you might remember that we have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning Biſhops and Paſtors and that before we mentioned Doctrine. What elſe is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the four precedent ſhapes. 2. If you were acquainted with our judgement, you might find that when we ſay, True Doctrine is a mark of the true Church, we explain our ſelves to mean the preaching of true Doctrine, and this doth ſuppoſe Paſtors and Teachers. 3. Truth of Doctrine is a more proper note of the Church, and more neceſſary than Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Paſtors. That Doctrine which is conſonant to the Apoſtles Doctrine is alwayes true; but Paſtors that ſuccede them are not alwayes true Paſtors, but ſometimes Wolves; and therefore if you had not miſled us, we would firſt have begun with Doctrine as the more worthy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You anſwer, <hi>It is no leſs untrue that Proteſtants maintain the Apoſtles Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Scriptures, they profeſſing a Doctrine clean contrarie and oppoſite to that which in them is in plain and formall tearms expreſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Prove this and you carry the victory, but I know you cannot do it, your inſtances are inſufficient ſome of them being not in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; others not the Apoſtles Doctrine, which you were to have proved, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence but expreſly in plain and formall
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170001:106"/> tearms. Laſtly, ſome Texts are brought in againſt us with which we fully joyn. But I will particularly examine your Inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Inſt. <hi>Traditions.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. <hi>Hold the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, whether it be by word or Epiſtle.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its moſt evident that the Apoſtle by <hi>Tradition</hi> underſtands whatſoever he had delivered to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> either by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or writings; (Tradition being then of a larger talent than now it is) and it is no leſs evident that what the Apoſtle did preach, was nothing but Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.20.22. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 17.1, 2, 3, 13. where you finde what <hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> even no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Annot. on Deutr. <hi>4.2.</hi>
                     </note> Your <hi>Dowaiſts</hi> ſay, unwritten traditions are contained, implied, included, in the Scriptures; ſuch the Apoſtle preached.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. True and Apoſtolick traditions we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly imbrace, yea, we account them worthy of <hi>Anathema</hi> who do not receive them. That which <hi>Clemnitius</hi> ſaith, is the judgement of Proteſtants. <hi>Apoſtoli multa tradiderunt unâ voce, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtles delivered many things by word of mouth, which their immediate ſucceſſours received from them,<note place="margin">Exam.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170001:107"/> Scripture, and we reject none of them, but whatſoever are agreeable to Scripture, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and reverence.

The keyes are promiſed to them as well as to him, <hi>John</hi> 20.22, 23. the other Apoſtles are to feed Chriſts ſheep as well as he; yea, it is the duty of all Paſtors, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. 3.

The truth is, <hi>Peter</hi> had no power over the reſt from Chriſt,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170001:114"/> for Chriſts gift of ſuch a power would have prevented the Apoſtles contention about ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, or would have anſwered the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, better then thoſe words wherewith Chriſt did anſwer. He might eaſily have ſaid, why do you ſtrive which ſhould be greateſt? know you not that I have made <hi>Peter</hi> your Prince, and have made him Supreme; but Chriſt thought of no ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſhewed that Proteſtants do not profeſſe a Doctrine contrary to the Apoſtles, and I further adde that the Apoſtles doctrine expreſſed in Scripture is fully received by them. We believe all that the Apoſtles have taught ſo far as God reveals their Doctrine to us. Its therefore a moſt falſe ſlander to ſay that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants refuſe ſome points the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, <hi>p.</hi> 65. We hold the Catholique faith entire and inviolate in <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s ſence, we fully believe all the Articles of its Creed.

But you object (<hi>ſect.</hi> 5.) <hi>It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident they were there being the ſame ground to aſſure us thereof, as of Scripture; or any other point they believed; and that without which (under a miracle) there would not be the leaſt knowledg of the Apoſtles belief, to wit, the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170001:114"/> Churches conſtant tradition.</hi> Anſw. 1. Its moſt evident that the points Proteſtants deny were not believed by the Apoſtles. For, 1. The Scriptures mention them not the writings of the Apoſtles approve not of communion in one kind, private maſſe, prayer in an unknown tongue, imagined worſhip, auricular confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, pardons, indulgences, reſtraint of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from reading Scripture, or Clergy-men from marriage, Popes infallibility, ſumpreama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of temporal and ſpiritual power, purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, prayer for the dead, or to Saints depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. 2.

The proof of your evident aſſertion contains divers falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as, 1. That the Scripture is known only by Tradition, or humane teſtimony, whereas
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170001:115"/> it gives teſtimony to it ſelf as I have before ſhewed. 2. That without the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tradition there would not be the leaſt knowledg of the Apoſtles belief. For, 1. God can make the enemies of his Church the publiſhers, and propagators of his truth. Thus <hi>Cajetan</hi> notes that by the Apoſtacy and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Jews we know which are the true books of the old Teſtament. 2. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might be preſerved though there ſhould be a general apoſtacy, and theſe could teſtifie of the Apoſtles belief, [2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 22.8.] as that book found in the days of <hi>Joſiah</hi> teſtified of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s commands and threatnings. 3.

Thoſe points of yours I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned cannot be evidenced to be the Apoſtles belief by the Churches conſtant tradition, you cannot name one Author in every age ſince the Apoſtles out of whoſe writings you can prove that the Apoſtles maintained thoſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which we reject, much leſſe are you able to tell us of any viſible Church or nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Councill that will affirm it:<note place="margin">Concil.

How then durſt he ſo adminiſter it? Was his practiſe contrary to his belief? This would be a great wickedneſs not to be imagined of an Apoſtle. 4. We approve of the Churches tradition as a witneſs of what the Apoſtles believed, but only in ſubſerviency to Scripture which doth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally diſcover what was the Apoſtles belief: if your Councills had told us that the Apoſtles adminiſtred not the Sacrament in both kinds, or that they allowed of prayers in an unknown tongue, we would not beleeve your Councills becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks contrary to them, and it is firſt to be regarded. But you reply to this, <hi>p.</hi> 67. <hi>As Scripture, ſo what it contains would be as to belief hid and unknown, but for the Churches information. Anſw.</hi> This hath been formerly confuted.

Your Doctors of the Church are as different in their Expoſitions as can be (as that Text of <hi>James,</hi> ſome underſtand it of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Unction, others deny that Extream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can be proved by it) and for your Popes they ſeldome expound Scripture, and when they do it, their Expoſitions are oft irrational, (as that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. by <hi>Lyricus</hi>) and ſeldom obvious. In this caſe, either the ſtudy of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture muſt be quite laid aſide, or elſe there muſt be ſome other guide thought of beſides the Church, which can be no other then the Spirit of God, by which we are enabled to judg
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170001:118"/> which is the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Cajetan</hi> ſeems to approve of this, when he adviſeth that no man diſlike a new ſenſe of Scripture, becauſe it diſſents from Ancient Fathers, for God hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the Expoſition of Scripture to their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but to Scripture it ſelf.

If it were not thus, to what purpoſe did holy Writers ſet Pen to Paper? Yea, and write not only to Biſhops and Paſtors, but to private Chriſtians alſo: It were a vain thing to write ſo, as that thoſe they wrote to could underſtand nothing of their meaning; beſides, it's more then probable, that the Apoſtles Preaching was of the ſame obſcurity with their writing. To this you give us this anſwer, <hi>The Apoſtles did ſet Pen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a greater confirmation of the truth, to bear witneſs to the ſincerity and candor of the Churches teaching and preaching, and not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to be his own carver and interpreter.</hi>

How can the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures witneſs to them, that the Paſtors of the Church teach truth, if they cannot underſtand the Witneſſes language? or what confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can we have of truth, if we muſt not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that which is the Rule and Touchſtone of Truth? The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> commends Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for giving heed to the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.19. calling them a light ſhining in a dark place; whereby he demonſtrates their clearneſs and conſpicuity even to private Chriſtians giving heed thereto. 2. Your words make much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelves, for they imply: 1. That the truth is more confirmed by Scripture than by the Church, therefore the Church, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of truth, is inferiour to Scripture. 2. That the Teaching and Preaching of the Church is not to be believed upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but becauſe of it's conſent with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it receives its evidence of ſincerity and candor from Scripture, both which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truths, but not agreeable to your Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. That the Scriptures are to be tranſlated into thoſe Tongues People can underſtand, elſe they cannot be aſſured of the truth by them, nor can the Scriptures be a witneſs to them of the ſincerity and candor of the Churches teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preaching.

See <hi>Tholos.</hi> and <hi>Ararius,</hi> who are ſo far from holding it <hi>an effect of great improvidence,</hi> &amp;c. that they allow it. You finde the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> pleading for himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.12, 13, 18, 19. and 25. and 10, 11. in both which places the Apoſtle pleads for himſelf, and that by Law which he interprets for himſelf. Now he would never have done this, had he thought it an effect of great improvidence, or an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of intollerable confuſion as you ſuggeſt it. Advocates do not ſubſtantially but accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intervene in publick judicatories, as <hi>Zorius</hi>

The reaſon you give of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers appointing certain ſelect perſons of integrity and ability, to diſpence the Laws, <hi>its an occaſion of intellerable confuſion,</hi> &amp;c. Is not the proper reaſon of that appointment; but rather the true and main reaſon is this: All men are not able to underſtand the meaning and ſence of Law, though ſome may be able; now a good Law maker doth conſult the welfare of the meaneſt ſubject: If ſome men ſhould han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle their own cauſe, they would indanger it through their unskilfulneſs of Law and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the adverſaries. So that the danger is not ſo much confuſion and diſorder, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of civil and particular rights, every man not being able to deal with every adverſary, nor to underſtand every caſe in Law. 3. All that you ſay makes onely againſt a publick pleading in Courts of Judicature, which doth not take away private mens liberty of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation abſolutely, but as to ſuch times and places; and there is none of us pleads for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate mens interpretation of Scripture publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 4. You confound conſtruction of Law by right reaſon, and by corrupt affection; this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no man that hath right reaſon can plead for in the behalf of any people, for indeed that would bring confuſion: but the former can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170001:121"/> be denyed to any; for the Law is founded upon right reaſon, and ſo far as this takes place, the expounding of the Law cannot be prejudicial to any Commonwealth, though it be done by private perſons. 2. You infer, <hi>If this be true as it is, what an undervaluing muſt it be of Gods wiſdome and providence to think in a Commonwealth of his own immediate eſtabliſhing, as the Church is, he hath left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to all a liberty to make what ſence they will of his Law.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We allow not that the ſence men give of Scripture ſhould be after their own luſts or wills. If any man give a ſence contrary to the mind of God, it deſerves to be rejected God hath not left to any one man much leſſe indifferently to all, a liberty to make what ſence he will of Gods Law. The Pope can no more claim that liberty than the meaneſt Laick, and therefore you either play the fool or worſe, to diſprove a liberty which no Proteſtant in the World pleads for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet I ſay God hath not left any of his children without means in the uſe whereof they may attain to know what is the Will of God in his Word. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. Indeed God hath ſet certain ſelect perſons of integrity and ability to diſpence his Law, but this is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to private ſtudy and meditation in Gods Law, the very principal charecter of a bleſſed

The Saints of God have earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly ſtudied Gods Law. Yet this was never thought to tend <hi>to bring the peace and ſafety of the Church into danger of ſhipwrack, nor to be the ſource of jars and garboils of Seperatiſts,</hi> as you wickedly ſuggeſt. Miſapplying and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture may have thoſe effects you ſpeak of: but what is this to the reading and right interpretation of it. Your reaſon for this your unſavory ſpeech is (ſay you) <hi>clear, becauſe all men are not apt to underſtand alike; for being for the moſt part of different tempers and compoſures, they have various fancies which of neceſſity will beget a diverſity of underſtanding Anſw.</hi> 1. You are <hi>Aeſops</hi> man <hi>qui ex uno ore calidum promis &amp; frigidum,</hi> in your fourth Chapter you proved the Churches infallibility by this argument <hi>viz.</hi> that it was framed up of men of ſeveral Nations, different tempers and intereſts, therefore neither could, nor can meet or conſpire to cheat themſelves and poſterity with a lye, <hi>p.</hi> 15, 16. But here the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument proves the Churches fallibility the fruit of diverſity of underſtanding. 2. I ſay, If Chriſtians were conſiderable only as men of different tempers and compoſures, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them, and that their different temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and compoſures were the directive cauſes
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170001:122"/> of underſtanding: I beleeve what you ſay of ſeperatiſts would be true of all Chriſtians, yea of all men in the World, and there would be nothing but jars and garboils in every place. Yea it may as truly be ſaid of your great Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies the only interpreters of Scripture, for are not they of different tempers and compoſures, and ſo according to your doctrine have vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fancies which of neceſſity muſt beget a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of underſtanding. If you anſwer, that theſe have the Spirit of God to guid them in underſtanding, I reply, ſo have all true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians as I have already proved. I deny not but there is corruption in the beſt, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their underſtandings, they but ſee through a glaſſe and that darkly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may miſtake a wrong expoſition ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a true one, and thus it is not only with <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin</hi> (whoſe names will ſurvive <hi>Romes</hi> obloquy and reproach of them) but with your own Doctors whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are not always the ſame. But we muſt believe (if we will) that only ſchiſmatical Proteſtants ſuch as <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin</hi> have different underſtandings and expoſitions of Scripture for ſay you <hi>they made no leſſe then three contrary and repugnant ſenſes of thoſe plain words, this is my body, this is my blood. p.</hi> 70. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

If we were to learn what the Pronoun This, (the very firſt of thoſe pain words) means, we might go unſatisfied away for any reſolution we ſhould have from you. One tells us it ſignifies Nothing; another, The Bread preſently to be tranſubſtantiate. A third, an <hi>individuum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> contained under the forms of Bread.

                  <p>For concluſion, you bring us in objecting for our ſelves thus: <hi>Thoſe ſelected Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the adminiſtring and dispenſing of the Lawes, utter by mouth what they underſtand; and they underſtand no more, then what their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reading and reaſoning are able to inform them; ſo that even this way men would be to ſeek.</hi> To this you anſwer: 1. <hi>Judges have not onely their reading and reaſoning to inform and direct them, but likewiſe the practice of former Courts from the very promulgation of the Law, at which time the ſence and meaning of the ſame was declared by the Law-makers themſelves.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. You unlearnedly diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their reading and their knowledge of the practice of former Courts; as if the practice of former Courts were not known by reading, whereas you cannot mention any other means thereof unleſs you can make out a conſtant unwritten Tradition from the Lawmakers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which hath been propogated from one to another, and the particular caſes of former Courts have been ſo various and ſo many, that they require ſtrong memories to retain them. 2. Law-makers are not able to comprehend all particular caſes that may happen, nor do they uſe to declare the meaning of the Law, unleſs occaſionally in ſome doubtfull caſes; for it is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170001:123"/> ſuppoſed, that the Law when delivered, is clear and manifeſt, at leaſt in the ſubſtantials of it. 3. Judges do not alwayes look ſo far as to the Law-makers, but to the practice of former Courts grounded upon right reaſon, which is indeed the foundation of all juſt and good Lawes. 2. You anſwer with reſpect to the Church. <hi>The Church beſides the Letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which ſhe reads aſſiduouſly with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting and prayer for a right and happie underſtanding thereof) and her own reaſoning, hath the help of a better and ſure tradition, and the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

I fear your commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations will not well agree to Popes, and the reſt of your Eccleſiaſticall Grandees: their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployments are ſo great and their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Scripture in compariſon of humane Traditions ſo little, and their devotedneſs to the Expoſitions of others ſo abſolute, that I cannot believe that they read Scripture aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, with watching, faſting, Prayer: and for your common people, they muſt not take that pains about Scripture if they would: ſo that you muſt either give us another definition of Church, then you do, page 73. or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Church doth not reade the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture aſſiduouſly with watching, &amp;c.</p>

For firſt, Biſhops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors do not ſhew ſucceſſion as Governours of the Catholick Church, but as Biſhops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in particular Churches.

There are no ſuch Biſhops and Paſtors, as can ſhew a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and doctrinal ſucceſſion without the leaſt interruption. 3. This difinition comprehends not Popes and Biſhops, who are parts of it: The Catholique Church as viſible and diſtinct from particular Congregations is more truly defined by <hi>Lorichius,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Senſus unitatis eccleſiae eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The ſence of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of one Church, is to believe that all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of the faithful are one Churche, and that is the Spouſe of Chriſt and Mother of all Chriſtians.</hi> And he fully and expreſly meets with your ſelf, and ſuch like flatteries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who monopolize the word Catholick to be: —<hi>Non tamen ejus ſedis, &amp;c. Yet let not the governors of the Roman Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll themſelves, as if that Church only &amp; (as they ſpeak) excluſively were the Catholick Church, and that it behoved us preſently without triall of it to approve of whatſoever comes from that See: and that for all Doctrines and pontificall
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170001:129"/> conſtitutions nothing ſhould be brought but an</hi> ipſe dixit. <hi>If we attribute this to that See, we ſhall expoſe the Catholick Church to all errours. And the Church of Rome cannot have any more peſtilent enemies, than thoſe flatterers, who do make her not onely the chief, but the onely Church, and extolling her above the Word and Catholick ſence of Scripture, above all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Fathers, yea above the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and conſequently above the spirit of God, do make of her I know not what Idoll. This root of Paraſites are overthrown by that of</hi> Hierom, <hi>The world is greater then a citie.</hi> So that it is evident the Roman being but particular can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Catholick Church. But ſuppoſing your definition good, I come to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can rightly be applied to the Roman Church, in the ſeverall particulars of it, as you ſay it may.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170001:129"/> laugh at you, ſeeing you will needs be ſo exact as to prove that <hi>Rome</hi> is a ſociety of men, I wonder you do not go more directly to work. Its not a direct proof to ſay in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there are ſub-Deacons, Deacons, Prieſts, Biſhops, chief Biſhop, a goodly Hierarchy or chief heavenly order; therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a ſociety of men; for you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that the pattern of your Hierarchy was brought by <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> from heaven, and that amongſt the Angels there is a goodly Hierarchy or heavenly order, ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell by your argument whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be a ſociety of men or Angels. Why might you not as well argue thus, In <hi>Rome</hi> there are common whores that bring in great revenues to his Holineſs, there are or have been divells incarnate conjurers, Magitians, Simoniacks, Whore-maſters: therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a ſocietie of men: I am ſure its as good an argument as yours, to prove your Churches manhood. What aſſurance have we that your heavenly orders are all men; for the Porrphyry chair is only for the Pope, and I have not heard of any other chairs of humanity for inferior orders. But you urge further <hi>theſe degrees are ſo maſterlike ſet, that they do not hinder and trouble, but as great and leſs ſtrings muſically tuned, make and preſerve the melodious harmonie of peace and concord:
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170001:130"/> Ergo</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a ſociety of men: Who that reads theſe arguments can forbear laughter. I am ſure they are neither muſically tuned, nor do they make melodious harmony; by this argument you might prove your fidle ſtrings to be a ſociety of men, but I grant your aſſertion to be true without your reaſons. 2. The ſecond part is—<hi>Linked together. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to the ſaid company, for in that company there is no diverſitie of belief, but one as Monarch ſwayeth in</hi> Europe, Aſia, Africa <hi>and</hi> America; <hi>where one and the ſame belief is imbraced for one and the ſame motive, Gods revelation propoſed by the Church.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If <hi>to be linked together</hi> be the main thing applyed to your Church in this ſecond part, it may agree to Heathens and Jews as well as Romans. If the faith wherein they are linked together with the uſe of the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which you ſeem to forget) this may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo agree with the Greek and Eaſtern Churches or to the Proteſtants, who (as is evident by their confeſſions of their Faith) do as nearly agree as any Churches ſubjected to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What you ſay of the ſame beleef, that its received upon the Churches account, I have before confuted it, and for further anſwer to it, refer you to <hi>Lorichius</hi> in my laſt quotation of him. Laſtly, your talk of your Monarchiall
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170001:130"/> ſway, &amp;c. is but a Popiſh brag, or if reall, tis an uſurpation, for which you cannot plead Law nor antient poſſeſſion, as <hi>Aronius</hi> will inform you if you conſult him about the Popes dominions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third part is <hi>lawfully ſent. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the ſaid company, for in that companie no man clarifieth himſelf, but one receiveth power from another, the ſub-Deacon, Deacon and Prieſt from the Biſhop, the Biſhop from the chief Biſhop or Pope.</hi>

Suppoſing you meant it of Biſhops, &amp;c. yet there receiving of power one for another, the ſub-Deacon Deacon and Prieſts from the Biſhops the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops from the Pope doth not prove that the Biſhops and Paſtors are lawfully ſent, unleſs it were made manifeſt both that the power of ſending were in the Biſhops and Pope, and that they uſed it lawfully; the latter of which eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wil be difficult for you to prov, conſidering that your Prieſts, &amp;c. are ordained not to an Evangelicall imployment, as preaching the Goſpell, and adminiſtring the ſeals of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

Its obſervable that there is no perſonall ſucceſſion of Biſhops and Paſtors (to whom you joyn ſub-Deacons, and Deacons) diſtinct from the Pope mentioned in any of your authors that I have met with, though particular Churches, as <hi>Spain, France,</hi> &amp;c. have had Apoſtolicall inſtitution as well as <hi>Rome,</hi> and its your task to prove not onely that the Pope, but Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church have a perſonall ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles.

She cannot ſhew that all her Popes have been Males before the Porphyry Chair, there was no trial of the Popes huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and that was occaſioned by an Harlot, gotten into the Popeal Seat: Yet its aſſerted and that truly, that a woman is not capable of pontifical power and dignity. 5. She cannot ſhew the order of her Popes: Its not known where to place <hi>Clemens,</hi> and for <hi>Boniface</hi> 6. <hi>Caranza,</hi> ſaith its a great controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt writers, at what time he ſate in <hi>Peters</hi> Chair. Now this is inconſiſtent with the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtration of Popeiſh ſucceſſion. 6. She cannot ſay but there have been great Chaſma's wherein there have been no Popes. There have been Vacancies not only for Months but years, through the contentions of Cardinals or ſome other cauſe. 7. She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but there have been many Popes at the ſame time, and each had their parties joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them. <hi>Caranza</hi> confeſſeth that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third there was a Schiſm in the Church for almoſt twenty years: There was three others at the ſame

John</hi> 24. <hi>Benedict,</hi> 4. <hi>Greg.</hi> 12 all three depoſed by the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> This may ſuffice to allay the Popeiſh brag of perſonal ſucceſſion, and therefore I come to the next particular, <hi>viz.</hi> Doctrinal ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then as to Doctrinal ſucceſſion. <hi>Rome,</hi> is not able to ſhew Doctrinal ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. There are two things concern her to prove as to this. 1. That her preſent Doctrine is the ſame that the Apoſtles taught. 2. That ſhe hath held this in every age ſince the Apoſtles until now: both which are too difficult for Popiſh heads. Let any man reade but the Articles of Faith, in that Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and there will appear a vaſt difference betwixt the Apoſtle and them: he taught juſtification by faith without the deeds of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.28. impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of perfect perſonall obedience, c. 8. 3. 3. 9. and 7. 14. 15. That concupiſcence is a ſin in the regenerate, c. 7. 7. 8. that ſufferings of Saints are not meritorious, c. 8. 18. That Prayer is onely to be made to the object of Faith which is God, c. 10. 4. That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church may err and be broken off, as the Jews are, c. 11. 10. 21. 22.

Again; let Papiſts ſhew us ſo much as one Father, that beleeved, and propounded the late Articles of <hi>Pius</hi>'s Creed as neceſſary to be beleeved in every age, and then we ſhall beleeve ſucceſſion of Doctrine: till then we ſhall ſuſpend our faith or belief of it,</p>

Its obſcure and doubtful, what you mean by <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> as diſtinct from the profeſſion of Doctrine. In your next words you call it <hi>Apoſtolical power,</hi> which may extend to juriſdiction as well as to Order, to Government as well as Doctrine;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170001:134"/> but in the confirmation of your aſſumption, you only (though frequently) expreſs it by a power to preach and inculcate the truth, which is no more then profeſſion of true Doctrine againſt errors: and thus it muſt be underſtood if the Argument be good. 2. Your felf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the truth of this propoſition. 1. In ſaying, <hi>Apoſtolicall power and doctrine [where Communion is not wanting]</hi> are ſure evidences of the true Catholick Church, whereby you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare then your enumeration, of particulars in the propoſition is unſufficient, and may be where the true Church is not, <hi>viz.</hi> where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is wanting, and this is more neceſſary with you than any thing you expreſs. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the former Chapter we aſſerted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of true doctrine to be a mark of the true Church, you vehemently oppoſed it as an error; how comes it then to be a truth in this Chapter? Is it a truth or no truth, a Popiſh truth and a Proteſtant error. 3. Theſe marks (or rather this mark) may agree to particular Churches, and have rather agreed to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church than the now Roman. Yea, they may agree to particular Chriſtians of other Churches; as to <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Athanaſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria; Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whom you mention and were diſtinct Patriarchs from the Biſhop or Patriarch of <hi>Rome:</hi> yea every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. To your <hi>minor</hi> I deny it to be true, your proof of I ſhall mainly examine. <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition (ſay you) I clear by inſtances in and from the Apoſtles down to</hi> Luther, Zuinglius <hi>and</hi> Calvin; <hi>and thoſe of ſuch points as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Proteſtants mainly differ in. Partu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riunt montes,</hi> &amp;c. Who would not here expect ſome great matter from this Doctor? yet who ever examines his inſtances ſhall finde nothing but a heap of lies and fopperies. For my diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hereof, I ſhall ſhew particularly what this man undertakes, and how he ſwerves from his undertaking. 1. He undertakes things. 1. To produce a Catalogue of <hi>ſuch points wherein Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks and Proteſtants mainly differ.</hi> So that to bring inſtances of ſuch doctrines as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants diſclaim as well as Papiſts is to lie groſly, and to befool the Reader. 2. To produce the generallity or univerſall company of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as appears by thoſe words [Chriſtians ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally maintained] ſo often repeated in the following inſtances. 3. To produce this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany profeſſing, &amp;c. when any oppoſition was firſt made; whereby is implied that when the Proteſtant ſuppoſed errors did ariſe in ſeverall ages, theſe Authors and Councels did then
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170001:135"/> ariſe and oppoſe them. 4. To bring in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Roman Catholicks: for he proves that the Roman Church is Catholick, becauſe of their conſtant oppoſition of Hereſies in all ages ſince Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The frothineſs of his undertaking appears in his ſwerving from it which comes not to be delivered. 1. As for his inſtance <hi>of ſuch points,</hi> &amp;c. who that read his Profeſſion but would expect a Catologue of Proteſtant errors from the Apoſtles down to <hi>Calvin?</hi> but behold, a Catalogue of ſuch Doctrines as Proteſtants and Papiſts comply in the oppoſition of: Here are fifteen inſtances, of which the ſix firſt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the eighth, tenth, eleaventh and twelfth (as he delivers it) fourteen and part of the fifteenth we utterly diſclaim as none of the doctrine of the Proteſtant Churches, but a dead baſtard which the whore of <hi>Rome</hi> hath laid at our ſide, inſteed of our own living child, which this author hath carefully hid from the eyes of his followers, making ſhew onely of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s own deformed baſtard. But leſt I should ſeem to affirm rather then prove: Our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning of them, I shall take a little liberty to demonſtrate what is the judgement of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches in thoſe points that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor mentions as errors: only firſt I will adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the reader of a jugling feat of this Romiſh artiſt, 'tis this, when he brings in Fathers or
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170001:135"/> Councels in oppoſition to ſome errors, he turns them from oppoſing thoſe erors to aſſert ſome doctrines, not directly contrary to thoſe errors, but rather to the true doctrine of Proteſtants: as S. 2. in oppoſition to <hi>S. Magus</hi> opening Heaven to Faith unaccompanied with good works; he brings in the Apoſtles and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> aſſerting that good works are Abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation: Sect. 3. in oppoſition to <hi>Eunomius,</hi> attributing Juſtification to a ſimple act of faith, he brings in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> affirming that Faith alone doth not juſtifie: Sect. 4. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Florinus</hi> blaſphemed God to be the Author of ſin, he brings in <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell, aſſerting that God doth no more but permit, as if God could do no more about ſin but he muſt be the Author of it: Having premiſed this I come to his inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inſtance, <hi>Simon Magus took upon him to open Heaven, to Faith unaccompanied with good works. Anſ.</hi> Is this the doctrine of Proteſtants, or do they open Heaven, to Faith accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with good works? Do not all Proteſtants require that the Faith which juſtifies be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive or operative Faith, and proclaim other Faith dead: read concerning the neceſſitie of works, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Confeſſion: <hi>Non tamen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet we ſay not that men may live diſſolutely, as if it were ſufficient for a Chriſtian on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus I have shewed his firſt defect, his non-production of ſuch points wherein Catholick and Proteſtants mainly differ. And truly <hi>I</hi> should think the man either a meer ſtranger to us, or void of reaſon in attributing ſuch points as theſe to us. But he doth but tread in the ſteps of his forefathers.

In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers onely two, as Sect. 3. or to make up a number, he adds the late packt conventicle of <hi>Trent,</hi> as Sect. 4. where you have <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who goes for a Monothelite with <hi>Euſebius, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,</hi> who is in this Authors Catalogue of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, ſpoyling mankind of free-will, and the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell, who in the judgement of the <hi>French</hi> Papiſts was no lawfull oecumenicall Councell. Do you think its a good Argument to ſay, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> or <hi>Tertullian, Origen</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> oppoſed ſuch a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; therefore Chriſtians generally oppoſed it. <hi>Origen</hi> (you ſay) ſpoiled man of Free-will. The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> robd generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of their dignity and ſupremacy above Popes: did therefore all Chriſtians, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians generally ſpoil man of free-will, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſupremacy of generall Councells; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are at <hi>Paris,</hi> you may ask the <hi>French</hi> Papiſts, whether they conſented to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and I hope you will not deny them to be Chriſtians, their King being <hi>Rex Chriſtianiſſimus,</hi> the moſt Chriſtian King in your Calender. Yea, ſecondly, he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the names of Chriſtians, but he brings
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170001:140"/> them not aſſerting his Doctrines, or oppoſing the contrary: in his Catalogues he offends two wayes. Firſt, by falſe, ſecondly, by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall quotations. 1. His quotations are many of them moſt falſe; as for inſtance, tis falſe that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. <hi>James</hi> 2. <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>ep.</hi> 3. or S. <hi>Auſtine de Grat. &amp; lib.

                  <hi>ſuch as do no good works, if they have age and time to do them are not found in the Book of Life.</hi> Sure this is inconſiſtent with abſolute neceſſity: again, whereas you bring <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that faith did diſpoſe and help, but alone that ſhe was too feeble and weak to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a ſinner, Its moſt falſe that either <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the places cited, ſay any ſuch thing: the like falſity is in other Sections as S. 8. <hi>Hierom. in chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> Sect. 10. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Confeſ. c.</hi> 7. <hi>Concil.

His quotations are many of them
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170001:140"/> very generall, and to be ſought like a needle in a bottle of hay: as for inſtance, Sect. 7. he cites S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Epiſtles: (now S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> hath 12. books of Epiſtles, and each book hath many Epiſtles.) S. <hi>Bede</hi> Comment in <hi>Cantic.</hi> Sect. 10. S. <hi>Cyprian, lib.</hi> 4. (but of what <hi>Quaerat lector</hi>) Sect. 13. <hi>Concil. Roman.</hi> Sect. 14. <hi>Lugdun.

               <p n="3">3 His third failing is, He doth not produce Chriſtians profeſſing truth, when firſt any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was made, as he promiſed, thereby implying that as theſe errors were broached in every age, ſo in thoſe ages Chriſtians then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving did oppoſe them in their riſe, and theſe Chriſtians he ſhould produce; but I finde no ſuch methodicall proceedings in him: the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with its Author is mentioned, and its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers lived ſometimes many years after it, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is oppoſing <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> yet lived almoſt 400 years after him. The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> oppoſe <hi>Florinus,</hi> yet were near 1300 years after him. Sometimes the errour was broached many years after its oppoſers lived.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170001:141"/> As againſt <hi>Luther</hi> he introduceth <hi>Cyprian, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Juſtin Martyr, Auguſtine, Hierom, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nyſſen, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alex. Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſ. Concil. Nicen. &amp; Omnia Concilia vetera, i. e.</hi> all the Councels that were a thouſand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther.</hi> So againſt <hi>Calvin</hi> he brings <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Dionyſius,</hi> who lived 1400 and odd years before him. Thus prepoſterous is he, though to ſpeak truth, it's not much material when they are mentioned, unleſs the citation of them were to better purpoſe then that for which this Author brings them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His fourth failing is, His Catalogue is not altogether of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, ſuch as were under the Government of <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops and Paſtors. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Euſeb. Chronogr. An. <hi>195.</hi> p. <hi>573.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. How this ſtrengthens your proof, I ſee not: Should the <hi>Jews</hi> have objected againſt our Saviours, and the Apoſtles Converts, that their <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctrine was generally received, and preached; yea, and that theſe Converts, (as <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi>) but a few days or months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their oppoſition held as other <hi>Jews</hi> did,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170001:142"/> Would this think you make for them that they were the true Church? The <hi>Gentiles</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the World profeſt againſt Chriſt, and his truth, and thoſe who were called out of them to receive the truth, did but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore comply with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> againſt Chriſt: Muſt this therefore ſtrengthen the <hi>Gentiles</hi> cauſe againſt the truth? It may be, your ſelf, and others who have apoſtalized from the true religion, but a few months before your oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, held as the reſt of true Orthodox Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did, yet this will not (even in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit) advance your cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its queſtionable whether <hi>Luther, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> did hold with you in all points, and that but a few days or months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their publique oppoſition of you. The Speech of <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro</hi> ſeems to import the contrary, when he tells us, that a great company ſeemed to wait for <hi>Luther,</hi> and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him as ſoon as he appeared; I cannot think but that <hi>Luther</hi> was againſt the ſale of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, longer then a few weeks or months before his oppoſition.</p>

The firſt Propoſition (ſay you) is evident, foraſmuch as Apoſtolical in a right and genuine ſence, ſignifieth to believe, as the Apoſtles believed, which is to be Catholick.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. It ſeems now that profeſſion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Doctrine is a convincing argument to prove a Company to be the Catholick Church. But Sir, why did you not approve of this argument when we brought it for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church? Or how could you without bluſhing tell us, <hi>That true Doctrine</hi> (which is none other then Apoſtolical doctrin, they being reciprocal) <hi>is no mark of a true Church, it being often found among Schiſmaticks, who for want of Communion cannot make a true Church, pag.</hi> 60. If Proteſtants can prove they believe thoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the Apoſtles believed, will you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them the true Apoſtolical and Catholick Church? We deſire no more, but that leaving humane conſtitutions and traditions, you would examine our Doctrines by Scripture, the true Epitome of Apoſtolical Doctrines, and if we conſent not hereunto proclaim us Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>

                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:170001:143"/>2. Your Explication of the word <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> is good, and it evidently ſhews that Perſonal Succeſſion is inferiour to Doctrinal in denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating a Church Apoſtolical and Catholick, and that the Proteſtants ſuppoſed want of Perſonal uninterrupted Succeſſion is no hinderance to their being the Catholick Church. All which doth extreamly weaken your former doctrines.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I deny your <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, and come to examine your proof of it.

Hence it was that in the firſt five hundred years there is little to be found tending to Popery; and that which is, is rather in notions and terms, then propoſitions; as in moſt ancient Fathers we read the words, Altar, Sacrifice, Merit, &amp;c. yet it will never be proved that they uſed them for that which Papiſts now will have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſignifie: In the next age there was a greater decay of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than before, ignorance did much aboudd, &amp; ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> attendant on it, In this age did <hi>Gregory</hi> &amp; <hi>Auſtin</hi> live; the former being ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">Rainold. praelect. de lib.

                     <hi>I reply,</hi> 1. If you ſpeak of Gods abſolute Power, its not meaſured by his Will. God is able to do more then he hath done or will do. Of this abſolute power <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaks,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170001:146"/> 
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 3.9. <hi>God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto</hi> Abraham. Thus we grant he is able to make more works, and of a piece of bread to raiſe up an humane body, he can turn one thing into another of a different kind. This Power as its not meaſured by Gods Will, ſo its not the foundation or reaſon of our faith, whereby we believe the exiſtence of any thing: But 2 If you ſpeak of Gods executive power which is the power meaſured by his Will, whereof you ſpeak, then we affirme this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is impoſſible to God, becauſe contrary to his will, as I ſhall ſhew even now. 3 Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay <hi>Gods Will is above our capacity, &amp;c. [Rom.</hi> 11.34. <hi>Deutr.</hi> 29.29.] I anſwer, Gods Will comes under a twofold Conſideration, its either ſecret or revealed: that part of his will which is ſecret as it concerns not our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo neither doth it call for our faith or obedience, but his revealed will is for us to know and obey. If then you ſpeak of Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will, you ſhew your ſelf preſumptuous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding into ſuch things as you ought not: but if onely of his revealed, then you imply that this Politopie is expreſſed and revealed unto us. Now this I utterly deny, for evidence whereof I ſhall premiſe that there are two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of Gods will whereby its fully expreſſed unto us, <hi>viz.</hi> Reaſon and Scripture, by the former its expreſſed more imperfectly and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170001:146"/> darkly, by the latter moſt fully and clearly: The former is ſubordinate to the latter, and the latter is perfective of the former: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe teſtifies of Gods Will, its in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to theſe, and is to be tryed by them: Nor are we to account any mans dictate to be Gods will, that doth not agree with one or both of theſe: I ſhall therefore ſhew the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of your Doctrine, 1. to Reaſon, then 2. to Scripture.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, you anſwer, <hi>Even in nature there is a reſemblance and light of this myſtery, one and the ſame water is in the fountain river and lake at once: one and the ſame voice in thouſands of ears at once: one and the ſame face in ſundery looking glaſſes at once.</hi>

                  <p>Reply, Theſe inſtances reſemble not this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh myſtery. 1 Not the firſt: For 1 if you make the Fountain, River and Lake, three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct places, then its not one and the ſame water; for you cannot ſay that the water of the Fountain is the water of the Lake, &amp;c. That water that is <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> is not other where. 2 If you conceive them continuately the water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a continued ſtream from the fountain into the channell, and diffuſing it ſelf from the channell to the Lake, then all the water in theſe
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170001:149"/> three partiall continents is but one numericall body, and the three continents are but parts of the ſame place. 2 Nor the ſecond: for firſt, voice or ſound is no body.

Thirdly, the place of ſound or its proper ſubject is the Aire, not mens ears. 3 Nor yet the third, for there is not one body really in two places, no more than if one man were pictured in ſeverall frames, neither of which bears any reſemblance of this Phyloſophy of reall bodies.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you anſwer, <hi>Should we believe onely that which we underſtand, there would not be any belief in us of myſteries of faith; they being all above the reach of humane capacity.</hi>

                  <p>Reply 1. If knowledge or underſtanding were not neceſſary to faith, why hath faith the name of knowledge given it in Scripture, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11. and <hi>John</hi> 17.3. If faith be an aſſent as Papiſts tell us, then faith doeth neceſſarily require knowledge, for we muſt know what is truth if we believe that it is ſo.

When dogs, cats, mice eat and tare in pieces Chriſt's body, or a weak ſtomackt Prieſt ſpues up the body of Chriſt into ſome filthy place, are we advantaged hereby, or can we glory in theſe ſufferings in this Croſs of Chriſt? 2. There may be other things infer'd, as 1. That the Prieſt that either through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ſuffers Chriſts body to be torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of dogs, cats, mice, or that willingly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to wicked men and miſcreants, is a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> a betrayer of Chriſt: and you may know him by his ſop dipt in the wine, which none of the people partake of. 2. That the Jews and heatheniſh Romans were more mercifull to Chriſt, then the preſent Prieſts and Phariſees of <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſtian: Thoſe delivered him into the hands of men, theſe give him into the mouths of dogs, cats, mice; Thoſe preſerved
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170001:152"/> him whole not breaking a bone of him, theſe tare him in pieces by wild beaſts: Thoſe gave him an honourable interment, (He made his grave with the rich) theſe buried him in the bellyes of beaſts, or caſt him into the draught.</p>

Reaſon, which teacheth firſt that neither one deſperate can predicate of another, (i. e. as you expreſs it when two diſtinct things of different kinds are affirmed of each other, which you ſay cannot be true) nor one thing of it ſelf in the ſame conſideration or reſpect, and whereas you ſay that the body of Chriſt out of the Sacrament before the words began is affirmed to be in the Sacrament after they are ended. This is not plainly or expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the words of Chriſt; for he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſaid, That which was my body before the Sacrament, is now my body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or this was my body before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. In ſaying, <hi>This</hi> and <hi>is,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that he ſpeaks of the Subject in its preſent capacity, and therefore ſome by <hi>This</hi> underſtand <hi>Bread,</hi> which is moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the context. Chriſt took bread and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſaying, <hi>Take eat, This is my body.</hi> That which Chriſt took, bleſſed brake and gave to them was Bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. Now this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated improperly of Chriſts body. Thus Chriſt is called a <hi>Doore</hi> John 10.7. a <hi>Rocke,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is called the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.10. <hi>The Sacramentall Cup</hi> is called the <hi>New Teſtament in Chriſts blood,</hi> Luk. 22.20. I pray ſatisfie me what may be the reaſon why bread ſhould become the body of Chriſt to us,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170001:154"/> and that the Paſcall Lamb or Manna ſhould be ſo to the Jewes: for Chriſt is called the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of Manna; yea in theſe Sacraments Chriſt was truely and ſavingly received by them: they did eat the ſame ſpirituall meat with us, and drank the ſame ſpirituall drink, for they drank of the Rock that followed them: And that Rock was Chriſt. What can be more expreſs than theſe laſt words, yet Papiſts will not here allow of Tranſubſtantiation. 2. That Bodies are the object of Senſe, yea and that the Senſes cannot be deceived in judging of them, whileſt the Organ is rightly diſpoſed; the <hi>medium</hi> is convenient, the diſtance equall, the Sences of more then one concur in judgeing and that the phantaſies be not hurt. But here if the words be taken properly, is a body which is not the object of Senſe, though the ſences be rightly diſpoſed, the <hi>medium</hi> convenient, the diſtance equall, &amp;c. If you ſay it may be done by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; I anſwer, firſt amongſt the miracles of the Primitive Church this was never numbred by them or any others that I have read, though its a greater miracle, if a miracle, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are mentioned. 2. In thoſe miracles recorded in Scripture which were wrought by tranſmutation, there was no deceiving of the Senſe. When <hi>Moſes</hi> rod was turned into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as it was a true Serpent, ſo the Senſes did truely diſcern a Serpent. When the waters were
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170001:155"/> turned into blood, the blood had the laſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, effect of blood ſlaying the fiſh in it. When by our Saviour the waters were turned into wine; as it was true wine ſo it had ſenſible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as the laſt ſmell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of wine. It was the practice of the Sorcerers of <hi>Egypt</hi> to cauſe an appearance when there was no reall exiſtance: Its the practice of Papiſts to urge a bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence without the leaſt appearance, like their forefathers the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> chargeth with ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Aliud erat, aliud videbatur;</hi> when ſome affirmed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was no true fraction, but onely in appearance <hi>Lorichius</hi> anſwers out of Ambroſe, <hi>Nihil falſum putandum in Sacramento veritatis &amp;c.</hi> We muſt not think of any falſhood in this true Sacrament, in the inchantments of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians the eyes are deceived that that ſeems to be which is not, but its otherwiſe in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Truth. [<hi>Gerrhard. Lorich. Inſtit. Cathol. de ſacr. Eucharist. pag.</hi> 72. 2.]</p>
                  <p>To this I may adde, that the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all parts of Sacraments muſt be ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſuch were the Sacraments of the Jewes, and ſuch without controverſie is Baptiſme, where the materiall part is water which the Senſes ſee, feel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore it muſt be ſo in the Euchariſt; (for there can no reaſon of a difference be given.) You cannot ſay that the materiall parts of it are bread and wine, for
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170001:155"/> you teach that in the Sacrament there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread nor wine, (though there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſecration) and the body of Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be it; for its not a ſenſible object being neither ſeen nor felt, nor taſted; and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall forms are diſtinct from matter. <hi>Aquinas</hi> delivers this Concluſion, <hi>Cum naturale ſit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas its naturall for man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the knowledge of intelligible objects by thoſe which are ſenſible; A Sacrament which ſignifies ſpirituall and intelligible good ought to be a ſenſible thing: which how you will find it in your Sacrament I know not. 3. That humane fleſh is not to be eaten: But if theſe words <hi>[This is my Body]</hi> be taken properly, then Chriſts fleſh ſhould be carnally eaten, which is doctrine for Cannibals, not for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon this very ground underſtands thoſe words, <hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> figuratively, and delivers this generall rule,<note place="margin">Aug. de doctr.

                     <hi>Si aut facinus vel flagitium, &amp;c.</hi> If the Scripture ſeem to command that which is hainous and wicked, its a figurative ſpeech; and inſtances in thoſe words in S. <hi>John.</hi> Papiſts give this reaſon of the inviſibility of Chriſts body in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe man abhors to eat humane fleſh, in the proper ſhape. But what difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one man ſeeing the ſhape of humane
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170001:156"/> fleſh, and anothers hearing of ſuch a thing to be humane fleſh though he ſee it not. Its the thing it ſelf, not the form or ſhape of it that is abominable, a piece of humane fleſh might be brought into ſuch a form as it could not by the eye be diſtinguiſhed from other fleſh, yet tell a man its humane fleſh and he ſhall loath it upon that very report: Though your ſeduced fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers do not ſee fleſh in thr Sacrament, yet you tell and perſwade them that the Hoſt is humane fleſh with its blood in it; ſo that I muſt needs ſay they have either weak faith or ſtrong ſtomacks. To conclude, Let me know to what end is this eating of Chriſts body, for its not turned into the ſubſtance of our body whereby it ſhould nouriſh the body, for then our bodies ſhould conſiſt of Chriſt w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous aſſertion; and for the ſoul its not nouriſht by carnal meat as fleſh and blood: ſpirits do not eat or drink, nor are they capable of nutrition; there is no Spirituall advantage comes by it: Beſides, when our Saviour had been ſpeaking ſo fully of eating his fleſh and drinking his blood, to prevent their carnall conceits of this ſpirituall Doctrine, he addi this wholſome and ſeaſonable doctrine; that for his body it was to aſcend up into Heaven where he was before, and therefore his words were to be underſtood not carnally but Spiritually. <hi>The words that I speak are Spirit,</hi> John 6.63. You anſwer, that

                     <hi>theſe words do not run counter to your ſaid truth, in as much as theſe words were uttered to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaits in anſwer to their queſtion of Chriſts Power, and not of the ſignification of his words.</hi>

Its moſt evident that theſe words are uttered for explication of the words precedent: for having told them that they muſt eat his fleſh and drink his blood if they had life by him; they queſtion what he may mean by eating his fleſh and drinking his blood and they ſeem to anſwer their own queſtion by a carnall conceit, which was (as the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> obſerve) <hi>They imagined that he would kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and cut and mangle his fleſh into parts, and ſo give it them raw or roſt to be eaten among them, which could not be meant ſaith Auguſtine, for that had contained an hainous and barbarous fact, &amp;c.</hi> He tells them therefore they muſt underſtand his words ſpiritually of our abiding in him and he in us according to <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Pray where are thoſe firſt words, <hi>This is my Body?</hi> You ſhut your eyes, and laid aſide your honeſty, when you brought them in as ſpoken by Chriſt before his ſuppoſed anſwer. But ſuppoſe them there, tell us next how thoſe latter words doe confirme the ſignification of them? 2. When you tell us, they knew what he ſaid, and both heard and underſtood the language he ſpake in, you will ſhew your ſelf a notorious trifler. Wil it follow that becauſe they knew his words, &amp; heard &amp; underſtood his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that therfore they underſtood his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? I trow not. Thoſe that read the hard of places of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles did both hear &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the language he ſpake in, yet knew not his meaning, and therefore wreſted them to their own perdition. The <hi>Jews</hi> both heard and underſtood the language Chriſt delivered his parables in, yet it was not given them to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> underſtood Chriſts language, but not

                     <hi>Reply</hi> A goodly Argument, and fit for your children that are content with ſtones in ſtead of bread. Chriſt is a Spirit, is he therefore able to give his fleſh to be eaten? then all Spirits have the ſame power. But Sir, why cannot a man, a body give his fleſh to be eaten carnally; I ſee no difficulty in it, nor need of any ſpiritual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to effect it, if there be but Popiſh, or other Cannibals that will eat it. 2. How can the words of Chriſt be called a <hi>Spirit</hi> in your ſence? for you take not ſpirit for breath, but proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Are words living and intelligent beings, as Spirits are? But I ſuppoſe this quaint Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was hammered out of your own brain, and though it agrees neither with Fathers, nor your elder brethren; yet becauſe it oppoſeth the

                  <p>You urge, <hi>To find fault with this were to blame Juſtice for giving to every thing its due in acknowledging the truth: It being moſt true and undoubted, that the Name of Jeſus, Altars, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and Reliques, bear relation to God, Chriſt, and his Saints, as Perſons in Dignities and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminencies to the ſame.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Queſtion is not whether eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ought to have its due, but whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious honour be due to theſe things, that we grant; But deny this: their mere relation (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which you mention nothing elſe) cannot prove it. All things in the world have relation to God, Chriſt, and the Saints; yea, ſome things have a ſpecial relation, which yet you do not worſhip. <hi>Emmanuel</hi> is as venerable a name as Jeſus, ſo is the name Chriſt: Temples have ſpecial relation to God as well as Altars; Dead pictures have not ſo much relation to Chriſt, or God, and their living Images, true Chriſtians; Reliques of Saints have no more relation to them then their works, or vertues; yet Papiſts give not religious worſhip to theſe. You muſt therefore give us ſome other chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters whereby to know what things are adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or what religion to God, Chriſt, or Saint, will purchaſe from us this honour, that we may know how and when, and to whom to give it. 2.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170001:166"/> as might procure this worſhip for them, yet its doubtful whether the images you give us be the true Images of Chriſt.

They did not worſhip the duſty manger, as you do the Altar, (whereon you ſay Chriſt's body is) nor the rack of hay, nor the ſwadling clothes, nor the Oxe or Aſſe, all which you ſay were about him. 4. When you ſay, <hi>Mary Magdalen, and the Apoſtles did homage to Chriſt in a poor ſtable, as a Mechanick, a Gardener, a Carpenter.</hi> You are much miſtaken, or have better tradition then I can meet with, I do not find that either <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſaw Chriſt in the manger, or did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to him like a Mechanick, &amp;c.

It muſt therefore needs be, that Chriſt had not ſo much glory in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation as afterwards; then he was onely meriting, but afterwards he was poſſeſſing what was formerly merited.

For the clearing of this, I obſerve that remiſſion of ſins may be conſidered two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. As it is a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall act, and denotes formall pardon.

As it is a Declaration of that act already paſſed by the ſupreme Lord. As in human Courts, the judiciall act or formall abſolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Judge, but the declaration of this is in the crier. 'Tis thus in the Church, The Church is the crier, but God the Judge; his act is an act of power and authority, whereby Pardon is formally obtained, but ſo is not
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170001:170"/> theirs. This is confeſſed by the moſt noted Schoolmen, <hi>Lombard</hi> is clear for it. <hi>Ita opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſacerdos Evangelicus, &amp;c. [Lomb. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 18. <hi>F.</hi>] The Evangelicall Prieſt (ſaith he) doth ſo act and judge in the abſolving from ſin as the legall Prieſt did on them that had the Leproſie. Now its evident that the Prieſt did not make them clean, but onely upon Gods cleanſing of them declared them to be clean, nor is this the judgement of him onely, but of many other Schoolmen, and <hi>Lombard</hi> proves it from <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Now if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not content with the act of declaring ſin pardoned, do in a Pharaſaicall pride (as <hi>Lombard</hi> ſpeaks) claim to it ſelf a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall power (which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls <hi>jus, poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>) then its certainly true that the <hi>Romane</hi> Church claims a power that belongs onely to God: But its certainly true that this Church claims a power; the <hi>Trent</hi> Councill is clear and full for it, [<hi>Concil.

                  <p>Reply, 1. That things that are like have
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170001:171"/> ſometime the ſame denomination, none will queſtion but the ground of this is not alwayes likneſs or reſemblance, as you ſeem to aſſert: different things altogether unlike, may have the ſame denomination whileſt thoſe that have ſome likeneſs cannot, The children of God who have his Image, and are partaker of the divine nature are not to be called Gods, though Magiſtrates are, Pſal. 82. There are two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or grounds whereupon the names of God or Chriſt may be given to creatures. 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the perſons ſtand in unto God and Chriſt, thus Judges are called Gods, and <hi>Moſes is ſaid to be a God to Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 7.1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Judges and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood in Gods ſtead, were his Vice-royes, his Ambaſſadours. 2. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authoritie ſeconding the relation, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, and all of you the children of the moſt High, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 82.6.105, 15. God ſaith of his children <hi>Touch not my Chriſts.</hi> Now according as God gives theſe names to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo may we, provided that we give them 1. Onely to thoſe to whom he gives them. 2. That we give them not to any as properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, but onely as metaphoricall expreſſions. 3. Nor ordinarily but upon ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and extraordinary occaſions and with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to Gods own words. Againſt theſe the men of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> offended when they called <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> Gods. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.1. Its not lawfull
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170001:172"/> for us to give the Title of God to Magiſtrates ordinarily in our ſpeaking to them, nor to ſay to others ye are Jehovah, or Chriſt, or the Evangelicall Prieſt or Mediator for the reaſons now implied. The Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5.2. If likeneſs ground a denomination yet it remains doubtfull what likeneſs doth it. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world but hath ſome kind of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, yet you may not call every thing God: though it may be this was the manner of the Heathens deifying of every creature till it came to herbes. 3. The likeneſs betwixt the interceſſion of Saints and Angels (ſuppoſing theſe to interceed though you prove it not) and mediation of Chriſt is ſo little, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought a ſufficient ground for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination. What ever you can ſay of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Saints and Angels in Heaven, may be ſaid of the Prayers of every Chriſtian that ſupplicates God for others, and what man would ſay that every Chriſtian is a Mediator?

They that grant that Saints can hear at any diſtance are not very wiſe to object the diſtance betwixt earth and heaven, and I am perſwaded none doth ſo: but you travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſet forth your late invented and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Looking-glaſs which like <hi>Randolphs</hi> Pedler you will not fall to vent amongſt other Popiſh trumperies: and indeed you ſhew your ſelf a pedling Scholar in bringing it in, impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly denying what you had expreſly aſſerted a little before, for you told us that Saints could hear at any diſtance; but now as if your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had checkt you for that, you tell us that its God in whoſe preſence they are that reveals
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170001:177"/> it to them. But ſecondly, how doe you prove that God is the Author or Cauſe of prayers to Saints? He did never ſo much as command them, nor the Prophets or Apoſtles in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture give us one example of them: Till you prove it a Chriſtian dutie, you cannot intitle God to it as the Cauſe of it, any more than to ſin which you ſay he doth onely ſuffer and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, p. 79. God doth not allow any to give his glory to another, much leſs doth he concur in aſſiſting him therein. Thirdly, its falſe, that <hi>its the property of every Cauſe to relate to its effects, and ſo to repreſent the ſame, as Looking-glaſſes do faces and other oppoſed objects.</hi> If this were true, then when you ſee a workman you ſhould in him ſee all his works, and ſo one man ſhould be a Looking-glaſs to another, which would make good ſtore of Looking-glaſſes and ſtrange ones too. Tis true, ſome cauſes doe repreſent their effects, ſo there are effects that repreſent their Cauſes, and that more like glaſſes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the face or other objects.

                  </p>
                  <p>Reply, 1. The Objection doth not refer to Gods foreſight meerly which may be from all eternitie; (He foreſeeing all things before they were) but to Gods actuall receiving of them from us, and ſo propoſing them to the Saints. Now I aſſert that this doth make the interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints and Angels unprofitable, yea no interceſſion: For firſt, according to Papiſts, the reaſon why we look for an Interceſſor is this, we dare not come to God immediately: hence is that Court-like inſtance and frequently ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of a ſubject, who not daring to come into the preſence of the King, immediately preſents his Petitions to ſome of his Courtiers, and by him to the King. But here forgetting your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you firſt preſent your Petitions to the King, making him your Letter carrier to his Courtiers; and this ſay you for this end that his Courtiers may move his goodneſs, which how rationall it is, let the ſimpleſt of your Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue judge. 2. According to your Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts the property of a Mediator or Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, is to offer up our Prayers to God. Now he that offers up any thing to another, doth
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:170001:178"/> not immediately receive his offering from him to whom he offers, but from him for whom he offers: To ſay Saints receive Prayers from God that they may offer them to God, is very harſh and unſcripturall language.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 2. If our Prayers go immediately to God, and then to Saints, and they immediately obtain from Gods bleſſed Will mercy and compaſſion from us. What room hath Chriſt for his interceſſion, or how are Saints <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores ad Mediatorem?</hi> Its difficult to ſet up Saints as Interceſſors, and not to nullifie the interceſſion of Chriſt Jeſus. But you urge, <hi>Princes have often notice of ſubjects impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and condemnation, yet ſeldom give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives of inlargements, but at the intreaty of ſome friend or favorite.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1 Princes do not uſually receive and deliver Petitions directed to their Favourites, that thereby their favourites may move them to compaſſion. 2. Princes often give reprieves or inlargements at the entreaty of the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned or condemned. 3. The Apoſtle tells us clearly who is that favourite, that receiving our Petitions doth procure reprieves or enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for guiltie ſinners, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. You deal deceitfully with your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and us, in making your many diviſions to ſeem few, and your great ones ſmall. Are the differences in the Roman Church only two, <hi>viz.</hi> about Predetermination, and the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Whoſoever reads <hi>Azorius</hi>'s Moralls, but eſpecially <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Controverſies, ſhall find ſcarce one point of divinity wherein there is not difference amongſt Papiſts. Some have numbered 300. different Opinions of Papiſts out of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Controverſies, and thoſe about Points controverted between them and us. Now if the differences between them and us be about Points of Faith as it ſeems they are, elſe we could not be accounted Heretical) and not meer Opinions: their is no queſtion but theirs are of the ſame nature, there being no Opinion of the Church but hath ſome one or more Papiſts joyning with us in oppoſing it. 2. You might have done well to have inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us what are Points of Faith, and what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for theſe Points you mention ſeem to be points of Faith. For firſt, thoſe things that

                     </note> Now its moſt evident that <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, did decree them Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who affirmed the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be conceived in ſin,<note place="margin">Concil.

Upon this decree of <hi>Sixtus</hi> The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared the univerſality of Originall ſin in regard of perſons) doth make a formall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> But before either that Pope or Councell, The Councell of <hi>Baſil</hi>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:170001:180"/> is moſt clear for it, decreeing it to be <hi>A pious Doctrine and agreable to Eccleſiaſticall worſhip, the Catholick Faith, right reaſon, and the Holy Scriptures, and that it ſhall not be lawfull for any one to preach or teach any thing contrary to it,</hi> nor is the other point of leſſer concernment than this. 2. Thoſe that hold the opinions of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> are by you counted Hereticks: for the former opinion they are judged to make God the Author of ſin with <hi>Florinus,</hi> or being a force upon the will with <hi>Origen;</hi> for theſe are the inferences you raiſe from our Doctrine of Predetermination: nor are you more charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us in regard of the other opinion of the Virgins Conception.

If they be onely School nicities, why do your Prieſts ſo much inſtill at leaſt the latter of them into ſimple peoples ears as a matter of Faith? why do they injoyn the obſervation of an holy day for her imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Conception? Why doe they indanger Chriſts honour by making his mother equall with him in impeccability, and that by a School nicitie, which if ſuch, might be well rejected?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you Anſwer, [It is as untrue, that generall and approved Councells have contradicted one another in matters of Faith,

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If by Conſtitutions of Government you underſtand Government it ſelf, this will not agree with what you ſaid againſt <hi>Calvin, That Chriſtians generally maintained and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the Government of the Church was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable by any mortal.</hi> But if you mean onely
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170001:182"/> ſuch rules as concern the Execution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſay the alterations made by Councels, have not been only of theſe, nor does <hi>Auguſtin</hi> intend ſuch things, as will appear to any that conſiders the place you cite for it, a Book of his againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> in which his main drift is to prove againſt them that Baptiſme was but to be adminiſtred once. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> objected that <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Africk,</hi> in a Councell did determine the lawfulneſſe of re-baptization. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwers, That the Scriptures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted of, but the writings of Biſhops may be reprehended by others more prudent, yea Provincial Councels muſt give way to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the former general Councels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be amended by the latter. 2. Its moſt evident that the Alterations of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Councels have been about matters of faith. I ſuppoſe theſe are matters of faith. 1. The Popes Supremacy, his univerſal Headſhip and Lordſhip over other Patriarcks and Councels. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls this one main pillar of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, and one of the chiefe Heads of your faith, for this you urge Councels: yet there are many Councels contradict this, as <hi>Concil.

Communion under one kind is decreed by your lateſt Councels: yet <hi>Caſſander</hi> tells us that <hi>Communion in both kinds was by our Lords inſtitution Apoſtolical tradition, publick and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual cuſtome of all times, and further was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Decrees of Popes and Councels.</hi> 3. Worſhip of Images is eſtabliſhed by later Councels, yet the Councel of <hi>Eliberis, Can.</hi> 36 and the ſeventh General Councel of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> did fully decree againſt them. Three points of religion are alwayes good and convenient, and cannot become bad and inconvenient by any circumſtances, as you ſuggeſt.

But granting that matters of religion may be altered ſo as the contrary to that was formerly taught and believed, may now, nay muſt be approved, this muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily make contrariety &amp; diviſion, and this will take of the objected ſlander.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If you ſpeak of rewards as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, man can never truely deſerve eternal, nor ſo much as temporal rewards, though one man may deſerve theſe at the hands of another. 2. It will not follow that Becauſe men can merit temporal rewards at the hands of men, therefore they may merit eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from God. For 1. Humane rewards are finite, and may be proportioned by our work; and where there is proportion there may be merit. But becauſe there is no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170001:184"/> between our works and an eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; there can be no merit.

Your conſequence is not good, Heaven is called a Crown of Juſtice, a Reward, a Goal, therefore God hath enabled men to merit Eternal rewards Heaven may be ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with relation to Chriſts merits, not ours. <hi>Primaſius</hi> calls it a Crowne of Righteouſneſs, with relation to the righteouſneſs of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in Chriſt: yea further, it may be ſo called without any neceſſary ſuppoſal of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit A Crown of juſtice is no more but a crown coming to us in a righteous and juſt manner, and thus it may come without our merits: As mercy makes us Kings, ſo it gives us Crowns: And what rational man can doubt but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may be free? <hi>Lyranus</hi> brings in <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> thus commenting upon the Text in <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, Si fides gratia eſt, &amp;c.</hi> If Faith be Grace, and Eternal life the reward of Faith, it may ſeeme that God gives Eternal life to the believer as a due debtowing to him; not becauſe he hath merited it by faith, but becauſe faith is grace, and life eternal is grace, he gives it there of grace. Heaven as it refers to Chriſts acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170001:185"/> and paſſions is a truely merited reward, an effect flowing from its proper cauſe; but as it refers to ours, its onely as an end relating to its means wherein its attained, or as an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect of that which hath onely a negative cauſality, or is <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non.</hi> And this is no more then what <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> obſerves.<note place="margin">Caſſand.

                     <hi>That thoſe things which we call merits are the way to the Kingdom, but not the cauſe of Raigning.</hi> Yea further he expreſly ſayth, <hi>That mens merits are not ſuch as that life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is of juſtice due unto them, or that God ſhould wrong men if he gave it not.</hi> And <hi>Durand</hi> affirms that <hi>God is not our debtor nor obliged of juſtice to us, becauſe of our good habits or acts which he hath given us; and that to thinks or ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is raſhneſs and blaſphemy.</hi> Yet this is the faith and doctrine of the generality of Papiſts, and vehemently aſſerted by the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> in theſe words: <hi>It is moſt clear to all not blinded with pride and contention that good works be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, and the very cauſe of Salvation, ſo far that God ſhould be unjuſt if he rendred not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the ſame, Rhem. on Heb.</hi> 6.10. But they have their ſentence from <hi>Durand,</hi> to which I

The Confirmation of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is moſt evidently falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>bare Actions void of deſert be looked onely as by way of gifts:</hi> For actions may be looked on without any meritoriouſneſs, yet be no free gifts, but due debts or duties: ſuch are the actions of Gods children; filial duties they owe to God their Father, as you grant in the next Section.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Suppoſing that inequality you ſpeak of be truely aſſerted. Its blaſpemy ſtill to make God a debtor to man, and to aſſert that God is bound to give us Heaven, and were unjuſt if he did not. Its the taking upon you that power which belongs ſolely to Chriſt in every degree of it that makes you blaſphemers, you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that Chriſt is the only Mediator of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. Now I durſt appeal to rational men whether it would not be blaſphemy for a man to ſay he were a Mediatour of reconciliation,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170001:186"/> and a Redeemer of himſelfe from the Curſe, though withall he ſhould ſay, he did not equal in worth his own price with Chriſts, but did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt's price was of infinite value, his but of finite, Chriſt had its deſert from no other, but his had dependance on Chriſt. It is the undertaking to be a purchaſer with money and price, when God calls us to buy without money and without price, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.1. If <hi>Simon Magus</hi> will think to buy the gift of God with money, the Apoſtle may preſage the ruine of him, and may conclude that he is in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.19, 20. The new Covenant is a Covenant of grace, the benefits of it depend not on mans merits, but Gods free grace, which according to the Apoſtle is excluſive of merits. <hi>If by grace, then it is no more of works; otherwiſe grace is no more grace, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8.4.11.6. <hi>Ferus</hi>

To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the glory of our ſalvation to Gods grace, and to give it to our works, is indeed to give that to our ſelves which is due to God, and is
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170001:186"/> nothing leſs than blaſpheming againſt God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Popiſh merits are very little lower than Chriſts, nay in many particulars they are made equall to them. ſee little more can be aſcribed to Chriſts merits, than the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> give to mans in their notes on 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>This place</hi> (ſay they) <hi>convinceth for the Catholicks, that all good works done by Gods grace after the firſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification be truely and properly meritorious, and fully worthy of everlaſting life: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon heaven is the due and juſt ſtipend, crown or recompence, which God by his Juſtice oweth to the perſons ſo working by his grace: for he rendreth and repayeth Heaven as a juſt Judge, and not onely as a mercifull giver, and the Crown which he payeth is not onely of mercy, or favour or grace, but alſo of Juſtice.</hi> What can be ſaid more for the value of Chriſts merits than this, that they are <hi>truely and properly meritorious, and fully worthy of everlaſting life.</hi> What is it more to be of an infinite value? And whereas you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay that mans merits have dependance on another for their deſert and worth. Its moſt evident that in the beginning of your anſwer, you lay the ground-work of merit and demerit upon free-will, as doth alſo <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerius</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you reply, <hi>Rather the</hi> Roman <hi>Church by aſſerting other merits, and withall acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deſert and worth to flow from Chriſts merits, attributed more to Chriſts merits than they do who deny other merits: for hereby are yielded to Chriſts actions a capacitie of meriting themſelves, and a communicability of the ſame to to other actions, which are two perfections; and to acknowledge two perfections in a thing is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to give more to that thing, than to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its falſ that they attribute more to Chriſt who acknowledge mans merits though they affirm them to flow from Chriſts; its a greater glory oftentimes to be a ſolitary then a joynt agent. Gods glory was greater for that he created the world by himſelf, than if Angels had joyned with him in it, though in their act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they muſt have had the Divine influence and concurrence. Chriſts glory was greater in being the onely Redeemer than if men and Angels had concurred to the work; therefore Chriſt glories in theſe words, <hi>I have troden the wine-pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Its not an attributing of two perfections to God to ſay, that he and Angels through his aſſiſtance made the world, or a giving of two perfections to Chriſt, to ſay that he redeemed not onely men, but Devils, though the Patrons of the Devils redemption might have urged it as well as you do communicability of merits: they may plead that the larger the redemption is, the greater is the glory of the Redeemer, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they attribute more to Chriſt than others, who ſay he onely redeemed mankinde. We muſt not build upon our own imaginations and fancies. Firſt prove that Chriſt hath commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated meritoriouſneſs to mens actions, and that this is one of his reall perfections, and then we ſhall conclude, that to acknowledge two perfections to Chriſt is to give more than to acknowledge one onely. In the interim, this may diſſwade us from believing you, becauſe Chriſt hath fully merited whatſoever is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by a Chriſtian, either here or hereafter. He hath purchaſed eternall redemption for us; what need then of our purchaſing that which
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170001:188"/> is already fully paid for? I will conclude with the ſpeech of learned <hi>Rivet; Meritum eſt perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis actio, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. Merit is the perſonall action of the Son of God incommunicable to any of his members in regard of meriting, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the infinite vertue of the perſon meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, anſwerable to the excellent weight of glory. Whereas therefore no ſimple creature is capable of this infinite vertue: it will follow that Chriſt alone, is the ſingular ſolitary and immediate cauſe of merit, who hath therefore fully ſatisfied and merited whatſoever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to us for ſalvation, [<hi>Rivet. ſum contra. tract.</hi> 4. 9. 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.]</p>

                  <p>Reply, <hi>They are ſo without Covenant and acceptance; ſo is obedience in a childe, a ſervant, a ſubject due to his Father, his Maſter, his Prince: Nevertheleſs, as a Father, a Maſter, a Prince, making a compact to gratifie ſome particular act of his Childe, his Servant, his Subject innobles the ſame, and intitles it to what was promiſed; even ſo by the means of Gods Covenant,</hi> (1 Tim. 4.

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170001:189"/> be free, then how can it be that becauſe of this promiſe our works ſhould be meritorious, But leaving theſe boaſters of unity to their hot diſputes.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, ſecondly, Gods Covenant doth not make our Actions ceaſe to be duties, for then it ſhould nullifie the Law of God which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn acts of obedience, as duties. But we muſt not ſet Gods Covenant and his Law at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as if contrary one to the other. The truth is, Gods free Covenant wherein for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt he promiſeth to believers ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is an exciter of us unto obedience, cauſing us to yield more freely and willingly than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhould: this is the Tenor of the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 1, 68. <hi>&amp;c. Tit.</hi> 2, 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is firſt the purchaſe of Redemption, ſalvation, deliverance from the power of Satan; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an Obligation to duty. A father promiſeth a childe that he will make to him ſuch lands freely, this promiſe doth excite the child to do for his father what he commands him, and to ſtudy in all things to pleaſe him, whoſe love to him he is ſenſible of by the promiſe. This the Apoſtle ſhews, when he ſaith, <hi>We lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> Exod. 20. And indeed the morall Law runs thus, <hi>I am the Lord thy God that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt have none other gods before me.</hi> Thus God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, I am the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170001:189"/> God, walk before me and be thou perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe it may be thought that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is meritorious becauſe God promiſeth life upon it: I further anſwer, this will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For firſt, Obedience, ſuch as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires is not attainable by us ſince the fall: and therefore the promiſe may refer to our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the perſon of Chriſt, whoſe obedience becomes ours whileſt we apply our ſelves to him by Faith. Or ſecondly, if it refer to our perſonall obedience, it doth reſpect our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence onely as a diſpoſition wrought by him in the Subject, upon whom he will beſtow life, not as a proper cauſe of life. As if a father ſhould ſay, If his childe pleaſe him, be hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and take good wayes, he will give him the inheritance: this promiſe doth not ſuppoſe that the childs pleaſing of his father, or being hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and taking good wayes is the proper cauſe of his receiving the inheritance, but its his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good will that gives it him thus diſpoſed and qualified: thus it was with the Iſraelites; God promiſeth them Canaan, onely requires that they ſhould perform their duty to him as their God and Father. Now ſhould any one ſay, that this promiſe made their obedience meritorious of Canaan, the Scripture would contradict him, which expreſly ſaith, <hi>Not for thy righteouſneſs, or for the uprightneſs of thine heart dost thou go to poſſeſs their land: but for the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170001:190"/> wickedneſs of theſe Nations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out before thee, and that he may perform the word which the Lord ſware unto thy Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 9.5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God doth no where promiſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of mens works as <hi>worthy</hi> of heaven, or to give them a reward, becauſe their works are worthy or condignly meritorious; or as your Rhemiſts ſpeak <hi>Fully worthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of everlaſting life.</hi> For if this were ſo, there would be no room for grace, for that which is fully worthy of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hath an equality with the thing which is therefore due to it, whether there be promiſe or no.</p>
                  <p>The Texts you urge prove, that God will give heaven to men in the way of godlineſs, patient continuance in well doing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they cannot prove that godlyneſs or well doing are the proper cauſe of our enjoying heaven, (the reward being hundred fold more than what we do) your inſtances are ſhort of proof for it; for if that Act required of a ſervant or ſubject be a part of that obedience which is owing to a Maſter or Prince, and for it the Maſter or Prince is pleaſed to promiſe a great reward with which the work bears no proportion; this act cannot be ſaid to be condignly meritorious of that reward, no not by the promiſe; but the Maſter or Prince is willing to beſtow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on him, and takes this occaſion for it, or gives it him in this way.</p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:170001:190"/>
                  <p>You conclude with ſaying, <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>deemed it no preſumption, to challenge at the hands of God a Crown of Juſtice for his good fighting, well run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſtant keeping of the Faith,</hi> 2. Tim. 4.</p>

But 2. How can you ſay you give the Sacrament its full due when you take away one of thoſe ſignes which Chriſt hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be uſed in it? I believe, if you took away the bread, and gave the people only the cup (which crochet may come into the head of ſome Pope for any thing I know) you would ſay you gave Chriſts inſtitution its full due; but if you give it its full due when you leave onely one kind, what do you think they did who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both, did they ſupererogate, or were they ſuperſtitious? Surely either you give too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or they too much to Chriſts inſtitution. 3. How ſilly is it to ſay, You <hi>believe</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170001:194"/> did inſtitute it under both kinds? the Devills believe it, ſo many <hi>Turks, Pagans, Jews,</hi> yet give not Chriſts inſtitution its full due.

Now if this be ſo, I am confident you cannot ſhew me an expreſs command for the peoples eating the bread, which you ſeem to grant, in ſaying, that in the primitive times, the people ſometimes received the cup, not the bread, which they durſt not have done, if there had been an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command for receiving the bread.

                     <hi>Make this,</hi> if it were for nothing but to <hi>oppoſe the Heretical Calviniſti,</hi> that render the Greek <hi>Do this.</hi> Sure they were convinced, that this conceit was but worthy of private obſervation, and therefore creeps in with the note onely: but further its obſervable that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſay onely, <hi>Take, eat, This is my body, drink you all of it—He gave it to them, and they all drank of it.</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Do this,</hi> not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>taking,</hi> or <hi>eating</hi> or <hi>drinking of it.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> unites them in one ſaying, <hi>Take, Eat,—This do in remembrance of me.</hi> So that to <hi>do this</hi> is to take and eat the bread, and drink the wine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Inſtitution, which doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concern the people. And this <hi>Dyoniſius, Carthuſienſis</hi> doth propound as probable. And its further obſervable, that whereas S. <hi>Luke</hi> onely of all the Evangeliſts doth uſe the words, <hi>Do this;</hi> he onely uſeth it with reference to the bread (which belongs (ſay you) to the people) not to the Cup which is the ſacrificers portion.</p>
                  <p>The precept which you mention out of S. <hi>John [<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, &amp;c.]</hi> which you ſay extends to the Laitie, I ſhall not much build upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I conceive its not ſpoken of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall eating and drinking. This onely I ſhall gather from it, that Chriſt is perfect nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that as his fleſh is meat, ſo his blood is drink both neceſſary for our nouriſhment;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170001:198"/> and that therefore as we have the Bread in the Sacrament to aſſure us of nouriſhment by his Body; ſo we ought to have the Cup to aſſure us of an intereſt in his blood: bread it ſelf being neither naturally, nor <hi>Ex Inſtituto</hi> any repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of blood: <hi>[Caſſ. ſupr.]</hi> And certainly from hence divers of the Fathers did conclude, the uſe of the Cup neceſſary for the people. See <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> cited by <hi>Caſſander</hi> to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you ſay, <hi>For Confirmation look up into the Primitive times, even of the Apoſtles and Chriſt,</hi> Act. 2.42.46. <hi>and you will find by their promiſcuous Communion, ſometimes under one kinde, ſometimes under another, and ſometimes under both, that they never underſtood of any Commandement of Communicating und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. The Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that as Chriſt did Inſtitute and Adminiſter it under both kinds, ſo the Primitive Chriſtians did uſe it. 2. What reaſon can be given why in other Sacraments <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the materiall part ſhould be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and appointed, and that in this it ſhould be left to the diſcretion of a Pope. 3. If it was ſuch a matter of indifferency in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times whether Chriſtians did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in either or both kinds, How comes it now to be a matter of neceſſitie, ſo as Chriſtians
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170001:198"/> may not Communicate under both kinds. But 4. I challenge you to name one ancient and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Author, who aſſerts that the Primitive Chriſtians did communicate in wine onely, or in bread onely, which will be as hard for you to do as for the <hi>Artotyritae,</hi> to prove that they communicated in bread and cheeſe. 5. The Text you urge proves not your aſſertion. For firſt, there is no mention of their communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in wine onely, which is one part of your aſſertion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Breaking of Bread</hi> doth not infer their Sacramentall receiving of Bread onely. Its a noted Hebrew phraſe, and is as much as giving or eating of meat of what kind ſoever, as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Iſai</hi> 58.7. <hi>Sanctius</hi> upon the Text, you mention ſaith, <hi>Omnis cibus, &amp;c. All kinde of meat in Scripture languge is called Bread.</hi> But beſide, how will it be proved to be meant of the Lords Supper. <hi>Lyranus</hi> underſtands it of ordinary eating, ſo do <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius:</hi> and why may it not be underſtood of their Love-feaſts, which were means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Charity amongſt Chriſtians; or of the diſtribution of meat out of the common ſtock for the relief of poor Chriſtians according to the cuſtome of thoſe times related by <hi>Sanctius.</hi> And thus it very well anſwers the Hebrew phraſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. where you reade of breaking bread to the hungry.</p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:170001:199"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſuppoſing it to be underſtood of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> it muſt give way to a Sonecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, the Bread being put for both Elements: elſe the Apoſtles did either not communicate with them, which is againſt the Text, or if they did, they were ſacrilegious in Communicating in one kind onely; there being as you ſay a Command for them to Communicate in both. 2. Elſe it was no Sacrament Commemorative of Chriſts death, becauſe this cannot be lively and fully ſet forth under one kind, as your ſelf have acknowledge. It muſt therefore either not be meant of the Sacrament, or if it be, Bread muſt be taken for both Elements, and either of theſe doth deſtroy the inferences you raiſe from the Text. To conclude, Look you into the Primitive times of the Apoſtles and Chriſt, and ſee if you find Communion under one kind an Article of Faith as now it is, and if you find it not, as I am ſure you cannot, ceaſ that loud cry of the antiquity of your Faith, wherewith you fil the ears and puzzle the heads of illiterate and credulous perſons.</p>
